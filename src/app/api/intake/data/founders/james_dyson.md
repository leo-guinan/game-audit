Introduction
So it took me nine years to get to episode 400. That means over the last nine years, I've read
and reread 400 biographies and autobiographies of history's greatest entrepreneurs. My
number one recommendation has been, for many years and still is to this day, James Dyson's
first autobiography called Against the Odds. I covered James Dyson's first autobiography on
episode 25, episode 200, episode 300, and on episode 400. What I've done is spent the last
two weeks rereading both his first autobiography and his second autobiography. Dyson wrote
his second autobiography about 20 years after his first.
So I want to read two sections from his first autobiography, and then I'll tell you how this
episode will be different from the other Dyson episodes. The first thing he says: "I am led to the
belief that for vision, one might equally well read stubbornness. At any stage in my story, when I
talk of vision and arrogance seems to have gotten the better of me, remember that I am
celebrating only my stubbornness. I am claiming nothing but the virtues of a mule." I think that is
one of the most important sentences in his first autobiography, and it's why I'm naming this
episode "The Stubborn Genius of James Dyson."
The second thing I want to read to you—he says this is a business philosophy which is very
different from anything you might have encountered before. "This is not even a business book. It
is, if anything, a book against business, against the principles that have filled the world with ugly,
useless objects and unhappy people. We all want to make our mark. We all want to make
beautiful things and a little money. We all have our own ideas about how to do it. What follows
just happens to be my way."
And that is exactly what I want to talk to you about today, which is Dyson's very unique
business-building philosophy. So what I've done is made a list of about a hundred of the best

sentences across the two books—126 of the best sentences to be exact across the two books
—that I think will help you understand and explain this really unique way in which James Dyson
And if I had to summarize it into a single sentence, it would be: difference and retention of total
control. This is one of the most important ideas that I've learned from James Dyson, one that
has absolutely grabbed me and held onto me for six or seven years. It says difference for the
sake of it in everything from the moment the idea strikes to the running of the business—
difference and retention of total control. This principle of Dyson will be repeated across
decades. He says, "I have sought out originality for its own sake. This is a philosophy which

what you realize is: oh, Dyson's innate personality is perfectly suited for the business-building
philosophy that he has created. This is what he said: "I have been a misfit throughout my life.
Misfits are not born or made; they make themselves. I was a stubborn, opinionated child,
desperate to be different and to be right." He is innately disgusted and repelled from following
One of the most important things that ever happened to James Dyson is that he winds up
meeting Jeremy Fry. Dyson starts working for Jeremy Fry. From a young age, Jeremy Fry
becomes his mentor, and this is one of the things that he learned from Jeremy Fry. This is one of
my favorite parts of both books: "Here was a man who was not interested in experts. He meets
me. He thinks to himself, here's a bright young kid, let's employ him. And he does. He risks little
with the possibility of gaining much. It is exactly what I now do at Dyson."

This attitude to employment extended to Jeremy's thinking in everything, including engineering.
He did not, when an idea came to him, sit down and process it through pages of calculations. He
didn't argue it through with anyone. So when I'm describing Jeremy Fry, what is so fascinating
about this is Dyson's describing Jeremy Fry—he's really describing himself. So when he says
Jeremy Fry, when he got an idea, did not sit down and process it through pages of calculations.
He didn't argue it through with anyone. Dyson won't either. He learned this from Jeremy Fry. It's
very important.
He just went out and built it. When I came to him and I'd say, "Hey, I have an idea," he would
offer no more advice than to say, "You know where the workshop is. Go and do it." "But we'll
need to weld this thing," I would protest. "Well, then get a welder and weld it." When I asked if
we shouldn't talk to someone, say, about hydrodynamics, he would say, "The lake is down there,
the Land Rover is over there. Take a plank of wood down to the lake, tow it behind the boat and
see what happens."
Now, this was not a modus operandi that I had encountered before. College had taught me to
revere experts and expertise. Fry ridiculed that. As far as he was concerned, with enthusiasm
and intelligence, anything was possible. It was mind-blowing. What's happening to Dyson at this
point in his life—different ideas have a way to just crack your mind open. This idea that he
learned from Jeremy Fry grabs hold of him and he uses it for his entire career.
It was mind-blowing: no research, no preliminary sketches. If it didn't work one way, he would
just try it another way until it did. And as we proceeded, I could see that we were getting on
extremely quickly. The root principle, which again, I think is now foundational to Dyson's
business-building philosophy—the root principle was to do things your way. It didn't matter
how other people did it. It didn't matter if it could be done better. As long as it works and it is
exciting, people will follow you.
Dyson demands difference. The more you read his words, the more you listen to him speak—I
watch all of his product presentations—he's the... out of every single person alive, he's the
very obvious: Dyson demands difference.

founder I most want to meet and spend time with in person. And when you observe him, it's just
Back to what he learned from his mentor Jeremy Fry: "More than anyone else, Jeremy
encouraged me to think for myself and to just do it." Jeremy Fry taught me without saying a
word that each day is a form of education. I still find myself putting into practice at Dyson some
of the same things Jeremy said and did when I worked for him half a century ago.
And so one of the things that Dyson and Jeremy Fry had in common is the fact that they both
used history—learning from history—as a form of leverage. They were obsessed and they
would talk with each other about the designer and engineer heroes from history. And it's from
these conversations that Dyson said this: "I was left with a burning ambition to emulate the
Dyson wrote, "I have an interest verging on obsession with the past." And he explains why this is
so important. He says it's about understanding and celebrating the progress that has been
achieved, learning from it and building on it. So you and I have talked about this recurring trait
for history's greatest entrepreneurs over and over again. I always say these guys have this
encyclopedic knowledge of history in their head.
Dyson took it a step further. He wrote a book called A History of Great Inventions. It is literally
an encyclopedia of great inventions. I have the book. I read it, I highlighted it. I thought I did a
bonus episode—I have to find out where that is. Maybe I'll just do an entire other episode on it.
But it is very interesting to me. I was rereading it as I was making the outline for this podcast
too, and it's interesting, the more I thought about it, it's: oh, look at the title that he chose. He
Founders - #400: The Stubborn Genius of James Dyson

didn't say The History of Great Inventions; he said A History of Great Inventions.
And I think the important part of the way Dyson looks at things is like, there's a lot of different
ways, this just happens to be mine. And my business building philosophy, which I think he just
absolutely nails, is tailor made for me. And so I think one of the most important ideas to learn
from Dyson is, yeah, he's going to get a lot of great design and engineering ideas from the past,
but he also uses their stories explicitly. He says this explicitly as fuel to persevere through the
inevitable struggles of building a business.
So both books are filled with examples of Dyson studying great inventors and industrialists and
engineers and designers, and constantly using their stories as fuel for his own. So one of the
most ingenious and most prolific figures in engineering history, this guy lived all the way back in
1800s. His name is Isambard Kingdom Brunel. So when Dyson is describing Brunel again, he's
really describing himself.
He says, "Isambard Kingdom Brunel was unable to think small and nothing was a barrier to him.
The mere fact that something had never been done before presented to Brunel no suggestion
that the doing of it was impossible." This is one of my favorite lines. "He was fired by an inner
strength and self belief almost impossible to imagine in this feckless age." That could be a
description of Dyson as well. "While I could never lay claim to the genius of a man like that, I
have tried to be as confident in my vision as he was. I have tried in my own way to draw on
Brunel's dream of applying emerging technology in ways yet unimagined. He was never afraid to
be different or shocking. He had to overcome the most incredible resistance to his ideas."
In case you don't know the life story of Dyson, that is exactly what Dyson had to do: overcome
the most incredible resistance to his ideas. "When he applied the system of the screw propeller
to a transatlantic steamship, he actually filled a boat with people and sent them across the sea. I
have asked people only to push my inventions around, not to get inside of them and try to float.
And at times in my life when I have encountered difficulty and self doubt, I have looked to his
example to fire me on. I have told myself when people tried to make me modify my ideas..."
Colossus, LLC.
I want to pause here. Think about this. I could choose any adjective to describe Dyson in this
episode. Why did I hone in on stubbornness? For the general population, stubbornness is a
pejorative. For entrepreneurs, I'd argue it's the opposite. Listen to what he's saying here.
"When people have tried to make me modify my ideas, I have told myself when people have
tried to make me modify my ideas, that the Great Western Railway which Brunel built could not
have worked as anything but the vision of a single man pursued with dogged determination,
that was nothing less than obsession." Throughout my story, I will try to return to Brunel and to
other designers and engineers to show how identifying with them and seeing parallels with
every stage of my own life enabled me to see my career as a whole and to know that it would all
turn out the way that it has.
Early Life
And one of the most important things to understand about Dyson is his need for mentors and
guidance. What played a large role in that need is the fact that he lost his father at an extremely
young age. So James was nine years old when his father died. His dad was only 40 when he
died, unfortunately dies from throat and lung cancer.
And what I'm about to read to you, please remember Dyson is writing these words 60 years
after his father's death. "He said goodbye holding a small suitcase as he waved from the back
door. That was the last time I saw him. His brave cheerfulness chokes me up every time I recall
this scene. It is impossible to imagine my father's emotions as he waved goodbye, knowing that
Founders - #400: The Stubborn Genius of James Dyson
Page 3 of 21. © Copyright Colossus, LLC. All rights reserved.
he might be on his way to London to die. 60 years have not softened these memories, nor the
sadness that he missed enjoying his three children growing up. How he would have relished
playing with his grandchildren, of whom there are seven."
"This was all the more poignant when I observed one of my own grandchildren, Mick, at the age I
was when my father died. Mick is loving, bright as a button and self possessed. Yet still at that
age, he took his ruffled, soft toy puppy to bed with him. He was far too vulnerable to lose his
father. I felt the devastating loss of my dad, his love, his humor and the things he taught me. I
feared for a future without him."
That is the first time he's going to use that word, fear. You will see that reappear over and over
again. It's really important to remember. Now, what might be surprising to you is his response to
the death, the early death of his father. He said, "The loss of my father made me very
competitive."
And this leads directly into, I think, another important part of Dyson's business building
philosophy. When you see how he gets ideas from the world around him, everything he reads,
he experiences. Remember, he said that Jeremy Fry taught him that every day is a form of
education. I feel that he has the ability to turn almost everything into an abstraction. He has this
mental habit of just pulling back from the concrete details of an experience and thinking in
terms of general principles, patterns or concepts. He has the ability to extract the underlying
idea.
And you see this with his youthful addiction to running. And this is directly tied to his father's
early death. "There was no one to teach me how to run. There was no dad to tell me how great I
was. Running became an obsession with me. Herb Elliott was the world's greatest middle
distance runner of his era. So I read a few books about him and discovered that his coach had
told him that the way to develop stamina and to strengthen the leg muscles was to run up and
down sand dunes." So Dyson starts doing that.
first."
at success."
Colossus, LLC.
"I got a terrific buzz from knowing that it was doing something that no one else was running."
Remember, everything ties back to difference, difference for the sake of it, originality for its
own sake. "I knew that I was training myself to do something better than anyone else would be
able to. As I started to win by greater and greater margins, I did it more and more because I
knew the reason for my success was out there on those sand dunes. I was doing something that
no one else was doing apart from me and Herb. No one knew. They were all running around the
track like a herd of sheep and not getting any quicker. Difference itself was making me come in
And then, you see, he has the ability to pull up more lessons from running that he's going to use
to build his business. "In so many ways, it taught me the most significant lessons. I was learning
about the physical and psychological strength that keeps you competitive. I was learning about
obstinacy." That is just another word for stubbornness. "I was learning how to overcome nerves.
As I grew more and more neurotic about being caught from behind, I trained harder to stay in
front. To this day, it is the fear of failure more than anything else which makes me keep working
Dyson continues to pull out ideas from running and will apply them later to building his own
company. The idea that you need a high pain tolerance. That excellence is the capacity to take
pain. "When running also taught me to overcome the pain barrier when everyone else feels
exhausted. That is the opportunity to accelerate whatever the pain and win the race. Stamina
and determination with creativity are needed to overcome seemingly impossible difficulties."
And so that combination of stamina and determination, it's the advice that he gives himself. It's
also the advice he gives to other young people and everybody that works at Dyson. There's
Founders - #400: The Stubborn Genius of James Dyson
Page 4 of 21. © Copyright Colossus, LLC. All rights reserved.
another trait that you're going to need if you want to adopt Dyson's business building
philosophy and that is a strong work ethic. Jerry Seinfeld has this line where he says that the
hard way is the right way.
I think that applies to how Dyson built his company. And you see that Dyson had this extreme
work ethic from a young age. He says that when he was a young boy, a typical day involved
waking up at 6am. He'd go for a six-mile run, then he'd go to school all day, and then he'd go
back out at 10pm and run for another six miles.
So then Dyson's got all these ideas that he learned from his experience that are spread across
the book. So I pulled out a bunch of them and organized them. And so one of the interesting
things that he says is that opportunity hides in plain sight. He says everyday products sell.
Although it is harder to improve a mature product, if you succeed, there's no need to create a
market.
And he's got really straightforward advice on how to do this. Try out current products in your
own home and make a list of things that you don't like about them. I found about 20 things
wrong with my Hoover Junior vacuum cleaner during my first attempt using it. Another piece of
advice that he has: do not sell a half-finished product.
Jeremy Fry hires Dyson right away to work on this project called the Sea Truck. And they made
the design mistake of not including a cabin when they first tried to sell the Sea Truck. And as a
result, it was really hard to sell. And so Dyson says this: I learned then one of the most crucial
business lessons of my life. To stint on investment in the early stages, to try to sell a half-
finished product, is to doom from the start any project you embark on.
Once they actually committed to investing and building a cabin, the sales of the Sea Truck took
off. He has another lesson from this experience that he carries with him for the rest of his life.

Dyson worked with Jeremy Fry on the Sea Truck for over five years. And as you'll see over and
over again, Dyson has an excessively high tolerance for risk. He leaves a high-paying, stable job

It is a wheelbarrow that doesn't get stuck in mud. There's a bunch of videos of Dyson's early
inventions on Dyson's website, which I highly recommend going and watching. And from this
experience, he took a bunch of different lessons. And one of them was that do not lose the
He had other partners, he had other shareholders, and unfortunately he listened to their advice.
It's hey, let's stop - even though it's working, selling directly to the customer - let's stop doing
that and let's start selling wholesale. He says the direct contact with the customer was the basis
of our success. When we abandoned direct selling, we lost that connection and the business
This also goes against his main tenet, that you have to retain total control. Another foundational
principle of his is that there's no such thing as a quantum leap. There is only dogged
persistence, and in the end, you make it look like a quantum leap. Dyson is pro-iterative design
over a long period of time.
Dyson is obsessed with crafting a high-quality product, and he made some of the best products

in the world by running tens of thousands of experiments throughout his life. Every single
experiment was aimed at making a better product for his customer. This is exactly what the
presenting sponsor of Founders does.
Dyson reminds me of my friend Kareem, who's the co-founder and CTO of Ramp. I spent a lot of
time talking to Kareem, and every single conversation centers around his obsession with
crafting a high-quality product and using the latest technology to constantly create better
experiences for his customers. It is exactly what Dyson does.
Kareem and Dyson both believe that nothing is ever good enough and that everything can be
improved always. Ramp has one of the most talented technical teams in finance, and they use
rapid, relentless iteration to make their product better every day. Just Dyson, so far this year,
Ramp has shipped over 300 new features.
Ramp is completely committed to using AI to make a better experience for their customers and
automate as much of your business's finances as possible. In fact, Kareem just wrote this: It is
our duty to be first-movers and push limits so that we can make the greatest possible product
experience for our customers. That sounds a lot Dyson to me.
And that is why many of the fastest-growing and most innovative companies in the world are
running their business on Ramp. That's just a stone-cold fact. Make sure you go to ramp.com to

his life to doing. And that is what Ramp has done too. Get started today by going to ramp.com. I

Now, another idea of Dyson's: the importance of being a person that has high agency. So when

Which is when experts - so-called experts - told James Dyson that his revolutionary
wheelbarrow, the Ballbarrow, was impossible, he said this only strengthened my resolve and
made me more determined to prove them wrong. Another one of his most important ideas, and
one I've never forgotten since the first time I read it: you simply cannot mix your messages
Not only - I gotta pause here. Not only do I love the stubborn genius of Dyson, I love the
products he makes. I think they're the best products in their category in the world. But he's also
an absolute genius when it comes to selling and marketing.
This is so important: you simply cannot mix your messages when selling something new. A
consumer can barely handle one great new idea, let alone two or even several. So he gives an
example. Dyson's vacuum cleaner could also be used as a dry cleaner for your clothes. He never
mentioned that in his ads. You want a single message expressed clearly.
You want a single message expressed clearly. This is important to repeat over and over again
because even the best among us make this mistake. I think Steve Jobs' marketing and his
communication skills are some of the best that the world has ever seen. And even he would
Founders - #400: The Stubborn Genius of James Dyson
Page 6 of 21. © Copyright Colossus, LLC. All rights reserved.
understand, and he would preach over and over again, we need to have a single idea expressed
clearly.
But he would even fall into making that mistake and fall into the trap of unnecessary complexity.
So there is this - Steve's advertising partner, this guy named Lee Clow. He's the one that did the
1984 Apple ad. And he also did the Think Different Apple ad when Steve came back.
And there's a great story in one of the books that I read about Steve that perfectly illustrates
Dyson's point here. So Steve was pushing - which was unusual for him - he was pushing to cram
multiple selling points into an ad. And Lee Clow did this incredible demonstration to convey his
point of why we're not going to do that.
So he crumpled up one piece of paper into a little ball and tossed it to Steve, and Steve caught
it. And Lee says, "That's a good ad." Then Lee crumpled up five paper balls and threw them all at
once, and Steve caught none. "That is a bad ad." Lee's point, just Dyson's point: the more
messages you throw at people, the less they remember.
One clear idea per ad wins. And then another great idea that he learned from making the
mistake—he's trying to save us. We're trying. He's trying to let us benefit from his experience:
appeal to a specific need. Do not make your product too wide. Narrow it down.
So in addition to making the Ballbarrow, he was also inventing all these other products that
would help with all your gardening needs. And so it says, what we were attempting to offer was
a solution to all of your gardening troubles. Consumers were simply not able to grasp so many
improvements in one fell swoop. The thing was too universal. It was too all-purpose.
Isn't it fascinating? He made the same exact mistake on the Sea Truck a few years later. He's
making the mistake again. This is why it's so important to repeat all this. Repetition is persuasive.
You have to remind yourself over and over again: you and I are guaranteed to make mistakes in
the future that we know better. We simply should not do them. We should try to avoid them as
much as we can.

Colossus, LLC.
Consumers were simply not able to grasp so many improvements in one fell swoop. And the
thing was too universal, too all-purpose. Had we begun it as a greenhouse watering system with
a single time-saving benefit, thus appealing to a specific need, it would have bedded down
Another super important idea: you have to think about the incentives of the people that you are
selling to. Again, Dyson has learned from his mistakes. He invents the world's first cyclonic
vacuum cleaner—that means it doesn't have a bag. Do you know what he does? He then goes
and tries to sell his invention to people that make 500 million a year selling vacuum bags.
You cannot sell a bagless vacuum cleaner to people that make 500 million a year selling vacuum
bags. No one is ever eager to fix a cash machine that's not broken. You have to think about the
incentives of the people you're selling to—something Dyson's going to repeat over and over
Retention of total control. He writes, one of the strains of this book is about control. If you have
the intimate knowledge of a product that comes with dreaming it up and then designing it, then
you will be better able to sell it. And then to go back and improve it. From there you are in the
best possible position to convince others of its greatness and to inspire others to give it their
very best efforts to developing it, to remain true to it, and to see it through all the way to its
optimum point.
Something that is obvious in both books, especially the second one—because it covers a much
longer, two-decade history of Dyson—the more Dyson was able to control, the better his
Founders - #400: The Stubborn Genius of James Dyson
Page 7 of 21. © Copyright Colossus, LLC. All rights reserved.
product and his company became. And anytime he didn't retain control, anytime he didn't follow
his own star—which is one of my favorite things he ever said—he wound up getting met with
failure.
When he gets kicked out of his first company, which I'll talk to you about in a little bit, one of the
reasons he said he got kicked out is, one, he didn't understand how to take care of himself,
didn't have control. But he also didn't follow his own star.
So one of the things that he learned from his designer-engineer heroes—these are people he
repeats over and over again, which is fascinating—was how many ideas he took from their
careers. People like the founder of Honda, the founders of Sony, the designer of the Mini
Cooper, the inventor of the jet engine. This is what he says: don't copy the opposition. Don't
worry about market research. Follow your own star. This is what successful entrepreneurs do.
The opposite of following your own star is following the herd. And James has a really interesting
take on why imitation is actually dangerous to your business. He says the best kind of business
is one where you can sell a product at a high price, with a good margin, and in enormous
volumes. For that you have to develop a product that works better and looks better than
existing ones.
That type of investment is long-term and high-risk—or at least it looks like a high-risk policy. In
the longer view, it is not half as likely to prove hazardous to one's financial health as simply
following the herd. To me, that is an echo of Peter Thiel's idea that he shares in the book Zero to
One: if you want to create and capture lasting value, do not build an undifferentiated
commodity business.
One of the positive byproducts of creating a truly unique and differentiated product is that for
innovative and intrinsically excellent products, markets are often larger than you can predict.
Dyson certainly found that with his invention of the vacuum cleaner and all the other ones that
came after that. But he learned that from studying the founders of Sony.
Colossus, LLC.
I've told you over and over again, it's very strange how many of the founders that you and I
admire—I'm talking about Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, James Dyson—they studied the founders of
Sony. You should go back and listen to the two episodes I did on Akio Morita, who's the founder
of Sony. You have all these legit geniuses saying, hey, I learned a lot from this guy.
And this is one thing that Dyson learned from them: the fact that for innovative, intrinsically
excellent products, markets are often larger than you can predict. Sony hoped to sell 5,000
Walkmans a month. They sold 50,000 in the first two months. By the time production ended,
they had sold more than 400 million Walkmans.
For that to happen, the product has to be differentiated and it has to have intrinsic excellence.
He says over and over again, his story—the reason he thought he was successful—he says, it
has all happened, I really believe, because of the intrinsic excellence of the machine. He's talking
about the dual cyclonic vacuum cleaner.
Another idea that I first read five or six years ago that grabbed a hold of me: the entrenched
professional is always going to resist far longer than the private consumer. So he tries selling his
Ballbarrow to home improvement stores, and all the buyers say, no, this thing is too different.
This thing is too weird. We're not buying.
He goes direct by running ads in newspapers, and he starts making sales immediately. The
entrenched professional is always going to resist far longer than the private consumer.
One of Dyson's heroes that he mentions a bunch is Thomas Edison. And an idea that Dyson and
Edison both believed in is the fact that ideas are produced by action. Dyson writes, no one has
Founders - #400: The Stubborn Genius of James Dyson
Page 8 of 21. © Copyright Colossus, LLC. All rights reserved.
ever had an idea staring at a drawing board, so do not do this. Francis Bacon got his ideas from
walking in the countryside and observing nature rather than sitting in his study.
So get out and look at things. And when an idea comes, grab it, write it down, and play with it
until it works. Do not sit and expect ideas to come.
One of the reasons, in addition to being hugely inspired by his perseverance and his unique
ideas and business philosophy, is that he's also funny as hell. These books, especially his first
one, make you laugh. So he ends this section: always bear in mind, though, that Bacon died of
pneumonia trying to invent frozen chicken. So don't take it too far.
Another thing that I love about Dyson that he shares with Steve Jobs—and really there's a lot of
ideas that, because I just did this episode on Elon Musk and how Elon works, Dyson and Elon,
even though they're in completely different businesses, arrived at similar conclusions—is that
founder-led sales is the most powerful tool. The best spokesperson for the company is the
founder.
And so Dyson says, selling goes with manufacturing as wheels do with a bicycle. Products do
not walk off shelves and into people's homes.
And when a product is entirely new, the art of selling is needed to explain it—what it is, how it
works, why you might need and want it. Only by trying to sell the thing you've made yourself, by
dealing with customers’ problems and product failings as they arise, can you really come to
understand what you have done, to bond with your invention, and to improve it. Only the man
who's brought the thing into the world can presume to foist it on others and demand it at a
heavy price with all of his heart. Steve Jobs is the perfect illustration of this.
Founder-led sales is a powerful sales tool, and so is my partner, Vanta. Vanta is a powerful tool

you're secure so more customers will use your product or service. Many companies won't sign
contracts unless you're certified, and this is causing you to lose out on sales.

Vanta like an intelligent security assistant that helps your company pass audits without tons of

On Hiring
Now, Dyson also has a bunch of ideas on hiring. You're going to see a lot of his ideas on hiring
sound exactly like what Jeremy Fry did: hire young, enthusiastic people not full of other
companies’ bad ideas. Jeremy Fry believed in taking on young people with no experience
because this way he employed those with curious and unsullied—this is a very interesting word
they used here, “unsullied”—and open minds.
The way that Dyson and Fry looked at this is that it might be impossible to unlearn bad habits

picked up at subpar organizations. And so he says, at Dyson, we don't particularly value
experience. Experience tells you how things should be done, when we are much more interested
in how things shouldn't be done.
If you want to pioneer and invent new technology, you need to step into the unknown, and in
that realm, experience can be a hindrance. “I employ brilliant young graduates with no
experience at all. I want free thinkers who can take the company forward and have revolutionary
ideas, just like Jeremy Fry did.”
One thing I admire about Dyson is he takes his ideas to the furthest point possible. Dyson
started his own university. And of course, if he's going to start his own university, he's not going
to say, “Let's just copy whatever other university is doing.” Dyson demands difference in
everything.
He says, “If I wasn't getting anywhere with the education system in my quest to raise the
number and quality of engineering graduates, why didn’t I start a university of my own?” So he's
like, well, if we were starting from scratch, let's just redesign this—what would we do?
And so he says, “There are no tuition fees. Our undergraduates work three days a week with
Dyson on real research projects alongside young Dyson engineers. We pay them a proper salary,
and then we teach them for the remaining two days. When the undergraduates complete their
four-year course, they will be debt-free.”
I think that's really important because one of the things that's so important to understand about
the first autobiography is the fact that Dyson persevered under 20 years of crushing debt. He
literally signed over every last possession he owned to finance his dream. There's no way that he
would saddle young people with that crushing debt.
He talks about it over and over again. He actually says something very interesting when he

compares what he had to do in college compared to his son, which we'll get to in a minute. One
One of his heroes is Frank Whittle, who invented the jet engine. This is what Dyson had to say
about him: “Frank Whittle is a good example of how you don't need to be good at exams in
school to change the world. Having left school at 15, he became a test pilot. His was a life of
learning and tenaciousness. Just like Dyson, he went on to invent the jet engine, changing the
course of aviation and our lives with it. Education should be all problem solving rather than
And so one of the things that Dyson teaches everybody in his company—but also learned from
Jeremy Fry and others—is that it can always be done better. He's got beautiful ideas around
this that we'll revisit multiple times today. Constantly ask yourself, how can this get better?
Jeremy Fry was always looking for a better way of doing things. Jeremy Fry loathed arrogance
and experts, by which he meant those who want you to believe that they know everything about
a subject. This is such an important part. The inventive mind knows instinctively that there are
always further questions to be asked and new discoveries to be made.
This is why the stubborn determination he has is so important: aim not to be clever, but to be
dogged, to be determined. When I got to this section, I wrote spontaneously one of the most
important notes I think I've ever read, because it finally clicked for me. He's talking about “aim
not to be clever.” He's got this anti-brilliance campaign he'll talk about a lot: aim not to be clever,
but to be dogged, to be determined.
A clever person doesn't spend 14 years building 5,127 prototypes of the world's first cyclonic
vacuum cleaner. A determined person does. Determination over the long term is the foundation
Founders - #400: The Stubborn Genius of James Dyson

that progress and innovation are built upon. There is no such thing as a quantum leap. There's
only dogged persistence, and in the end, you make it look like a quantum leap.
Dyson brings up the fact that everybody tried to get him to sell the company over and over
again as soon as he had a little bit of success. And if you actually watch how he spends his time,
he likes designing things, he likes being in the factory, he likes being on the production lines. He
says, “I happen to find factories and production lines romantic places. They are truly exciting.”
It's a great example of this maxim: you don't work all your life to do what you love, to not do it.
Go back to his idea of the importance of retention of total control. This is also something he
learned from Jeremy Fry when he analyzed how Fry organized his business.
“If you have a good idea for a new product, you engineer, you prototype it, you manufacture it,
you market, and you sell it. Retain total control.” And to do this, you must have a skepticism of
experts. If you want to do something new, if you want to do something your own way, you must
have a skepticism of experts.
Experts tend to be confident that they have all the answers, and because of this trait, they can
kill new ideas. This is why I have long admired engineers like Alec Issigonis and André Citroën,
who questioned orthodoxy, experimented, took calculated risks, stood on the edge of error, and
got things right. And when they got there, they continued to ask questions. He will bring up
both Alec and André over and over again.
Another person that he greatly admired, he wound up reading a biography when he was in
college of Buckminster Fuller. And he loved what Buckminster Fuller said: "You never change
things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, you build a new model that makes
the existing model obsolete." And to do that, you need new thinking about old problems.
Buckminster Fuller had been described as one of the century's greatest dreamers. Fuller dreamt
because his vision was of a world that did not yet exist. The value of dreaming was the first

thing that I learned from him. Another one of Dyson's ideas is, if it's not beautiful, you're not
done. It is only by remaining as close as possible to the pure function of the object that beauty
And then once you build something beautiful, this is how you sell it: You need to tell the story of
how your product is made. This is genius. This is also a very enduring part of human nature.
People buy stories. I can give you examples going back 200 years in the history of
People buy stories. You need to educate them on how your product is made, how it's designed,
why it's designed. This is genius. So think about this: You're going to walk into a store. This is on

are going to look very similar. Then you get down to this weird, strange-looking one that doesn't
have a bag and so that catches your eye. And then hanging from the handle of this strange-
looking vacuum cleaner is this story that tells the story of who made it and why it was made.
So this idea he calls the story leaflet. So it says it was a small booklet. We reckoned that if
people were going to spend £200 on this vacuum cleaner which was invented, engineered and
designed by one person who was personally accountable for everyone that was sold, then they
had a right to know who I was. The fact that I was a bloke making and caring about vacuum

cleaners was a selling point that would be useful to make clear.
So we produced this little booklet that told in a couple of hundred words the story of the Dual
Cyclone. And we persuaded our retailers to hang one on every Dyson in their shop. Customers
would read the story and then they'd buy the vacuum cleaner.
Steve Jobs said that the storyteller is the most powerful person in the world. Don Valentine,
founder of Sequoia, says the art of storytelling is critically important. Most of the entrepreneurs
who come talk to us cannot tell a story. Learning to tell a story is incredibly important because
that's how the money works. The money flows as a function of the stories.
People buy stories. That is exactly what my new partner Collateral does. Collateral transforms
your complex ideas into compelling narratives. I need you to remember their website, which is
easy to remember because it's collateral.com.
Collateral crafts institutional-grade marketing collateral. And they do this for private equity,
private credit, real estate, venture capital, family offices, hedge funds, oil and gas companies, all
kinds of businesses. I have friends that have used Collateral for their marketing collateral and
have raised billions of dollars of capital and have made hundreds of millions of dollars.
I will leave a link down below, but make sure you go to collateral.com and improve the way that
your company is telling its own story. Storytelling is one of the highest forms of leverage and
you should invest heavily in it. And you can do that by going to collateral.com.
Now, I want to go back to this idea that Dyson's philosophy, his company building philosophy, it
only works if you are like the work and you are like Dyson. And so Dyson was talking about the
fact that he didn't have a father. He was very scared that he was going to fail.
And he talks about realizing, oh, I'm very different from my peers. And one of the ways that he
realized this, or one of the first examples of where he realized this is in college. And he says, "I
was motivated in an almost devilish way compared to the other students."

like he did. And Dyson says something very fascinating here.

And in the second autobiography, he talks about the difference. The fact that James did not
party in college. He was very focused, disciplined. He was very serious. He worked all the time
And he talked about the fact that he built an entirely different world for his son to grow up in.
And so by the time his son gets to college, they're very successful. His son didn't have to live
He says, "No amount of ambition for my son's professional happiness could have made me wish
on him the fear of failure that drove me then and still does." And so I think it's key to ask, why is
Dyson... You know, this guy's just a... He brings up the fear of failure over and over again. He
brings up the fact that he's just obsessed with the retention of total control.
So why is he so obsessed with control and driven by a fear of failure? He is kicked out of his
own company when he's 32 years old. So keep in mind, this is what I mentioned earlier. He left a
job that he loved with his mentor that he treasured to be his own man.
He is a born entrepreneur, and he did this when he had two little kids and a big mortgage. That's
what I said earlier. Risk is another important part of his philosophy. So he had partners. This is
They screwed him over and kicked him out of the company. And this is what he says about this
on his relationships with the products that he lost: "They were part of me. To lose my invention
was like giving birth and then losing the child. I was completely shattered by it. I had lost five

Page 12 of 21. © Copyright Colossus, LLC. All rights reserved.
years of work. I had failed to protect the one thing that was most valuable to me. If I had kept
control, I could have done what I wanted. I learned very much the hard way. I should have held
onto the patent and licensed it to the company."
So he talked about it over and over again. He was the inventor. Then when they form a company
around this invention, he signed the patent over to the company. But that means if he lost the
company, he lost the patent. And it's exactly what happened.
"I lost the license, the patent and the company. In this sense, the Ballbarrow, my first consumer
product, was a failure, but one from which I had learned valuable lessons. There was a lesson
about not assigning patents, another about not having shareholders. I learned the importance of
having absolute control of my company. I knew how to make and sell, but not how to look after
myself. From then on, I was determined not to let go of my inventions, patents and companies.
Today, Dyson is a global company and I own it completely."
He has no shareholders. I own it. And this really matters to me. It remains a private company.
Why is that so important to him? I think you've already picked up on this now.
Control is more important than money to him. When you own the whole company, all decisions
are your own. That is way more important to Dyson than money is. And what's funny about this
is Dyson is the first time where I realized this idea that I describe as anti-business billionaire.
You have these people that are so obsessed with the quality of the product that they're making
and so they make a bunch of non-financial decisions and it's all about increasing the quality of
the product. So I mean, people like James Dyson, people like Steve Jobs, people like Yvon
Chouinard of Patagonia. And what's fascinating about this is if you obsess over the quality of
the product you're making and you retain control of your company over the long term, they
wind up with the money anyways.

anyone to help.

And what's fascinating about this part of the story, it's his lowest point in his life. But this is also
the beginning of the greatest adventure and greatest company. This is the beginning of Dyson.
I was penniless again with no job and no income. Now he has three kids. I had three adorable
children, a large mortgage to pay, and nothing to show for the past five years of toil. This was a
very low moment and deeply worrying. My confidence took a big blow and it would take some

actually gives Dyson $25,000 to start his first vacuum cleaner company. And Dyson talks about
why this is so important. Fry knew that things don't always work out immediately and that
And then we're going to talk about superhuman levels of persistence for three years.
Remember, he has this idea for dual cyclone vacuum cleaner. He doesn't know how to make it
yet. So for three years, for the next three years, I made cyclones alone. I could not afford to hire
He sets up in this little coach house in his backyard. This coach house has no water, no heating,
no phone, no gas, or electricity. This is going to be the beginning of Dyson, one of the most
valuable privately held companies in the world.
So one of the first things he does, he says, I put in electricity and gave myself a single light bulb
to work by. I had nothing but a workbench and a few simple tools. But I was determined that
here I would make the damn thing myself. I made a new prototype every day for more than a
thousand days.
Founders - #400: The Stubborn Genius of James Dyson
Page 13 of 21. © Copyright Colossus, LLC. All rights reserved.
And to me, this is the most important part of the story. This is the part that's full of terror and
agony and doubt. Listen to what he says about the next 14 years of struggle. While it's easy, of
course, for me to celebrate my doggedness now and say, that's all you need to succeed, the
truth is that it demoralized me terribly.
I would crawl into the house every night covered in dust after a long day, exhausted and
depressed because the day's cyclone had not worked. There were times when I thought it would
never work, that I would keep on making cyclone after cyclone, never going forwards, never
going backwards, until I died. And he's got a beautifully simple maxim about this: Perseverance
is not cheap.
Dyson's instincts are obviously to manufacture the product himself, but he was out of money
and he's deep in debt. So him and Jeremy Fry decide, we're going to try to license it first. We're
going to invent it and then we're going to let a larger company pick up the bill of manufacturing.
We'll get a little bit of money up front and then we'll get a royalty on every single one that is
sold.
That idea did not work out at all. After two years of trying and then failing to license his
invention, this is what he said: bankruptcy or death looked the most likely outcome of efforts.
Three years into trying to license and he had still not made a penny. This is what he says about
that time in his life: My doggedness and self-belief, in the absence of any real evidence that
they were justified, were beginning to look more and more like insanity.
And one thing that he knows in his bones is if he didn't stay on top of this, the project would
have died. He says a project will die if the original designer doesn't stay on it. The self-belief is
not there to press through the hard times.
And so after going down this licensing path and seeing very little progress, Dyson says, forget it.
I'm just going to do it myself. And so he writes, almost all of our license agreements had failed

and precious time was wasted. Instead of relying on other companies to make our technology,
We could take on these competitors that were content selling bags and their loss of suction,
and we'd be free to determine our own future, our own development and our own designs.
Instead of feeling dread about taking on this immense task of becoming a manufacturer, we felt
And so again we see the stubborn genius of James Dyson. He tried. This is such an important
part. He tried. Dyson tried to raise money. He does not have any money. He tried to raise money
to go into production by selling equity in his company and no one would invest.
So he borrows $600,000 for the tooling that he needs by putting up his house as collateral. And
this is what he said about this time in his life: I am not one to give up. This is very important.
I was talking to Todd Graves, the founder of Raising Cane's, about this. Todd was on that show
Shark Tank, and he told me that he had a problem essentially, you know, you go on the show and
you kind of pass judgment on entrepreneurs' ideas and he just had a problem putting them
down. Because at the beginning of Raising Cane's, a lot like Dyson, Todd had to go to insane
lengths to get the money to chase after his dream when other people wouldn't invest.
And I just remember during this part of our conversation, I was banging on the table. I was
literally pounding on the table. I think I was yelling "Fuck Shark Tank" or something like that. And
it's... I have nothing against the show or the people that work on it, but the arrogance that
people have that think they have some kind of magical predictive ability...
Founders - #400: The Stubborn Genius of James Dyson

Just think about this. Dyson will be one of the most valuable businesses on the planet and no
investor believed in it. Not a single one. Not a single investor believed in it. I get asked by
founders all the time, "What do you think of my idea?" And my answer is all the same: I don't
know. And it doesn't matter what I think. It matters what you will do. And no one knows what
you will do more than you.
Dyson was never going to quit. He says, as I often said, I aim not to be clever, but to be dogged.
And my doggedness had got me so far to a point where I had my very own cyclonic vacuum
cleaner.
At last, on May 2, 1992. This date is important. On May 2, 1992, I found myself looking at the first
fully operational, visually perfect Dyson dual cyclone. I was 31 years old when I tore the bag off
my Hoover and stuck a cereal packet in the hole. May 2, 1992, was my 45th birthday. 5,127
prototypes. 14 years of struggle, one man refusing to quit, one man refusing to retreat.
How could you not find that inspiring? If you think about everything that will happen over the
next 30 years after he persevered for that, all the success, the joy, the accomplishment that
would have not happened if he quit, that right there is why this is my number one
recommendation.
This is not something that 1% of people would do. This is much, much rarer. This is more like
0.000001% of people would do this. And it turns out that someone who perseveres through
that and has 40 years of experience is someone we should read about. It's someone we should
listen to.
It all goes down to what he said at the beginning: The vision of a single man pursued with
dogged determination that was nothing less than obsession. Listen to how he talks about this.
This is after he sets up his own factory: now that we're making ourselves under our own total
control. There's that word again. We were making far better products, more of them, and much
quicker.
Colossus, LLC.
I cradled in my arms a dual cyclone built by my own staff at my own factory. It was amazing. A
vacuum cleaner designed entirely by me, incorporating innovations up to the very latest point at
which my technology had arrived, to be produced and marketed and sold under my own
exclusive direction was, to be frank, what this whole thing had been about.
15 years of invention, frustration and determination were finally beginning to pay off. I was now
a proper manufacturer. It was thrilling to see the sight and sound of a production line in full
swing. I found it impressive. I found it staggering even. And I still do. That is incredible.
Imagine how it felt, how it feels for him to be able to write those words, because he's writing
those words 30 years after it happened and he still feels that way. And the way he describes this
is, in my opinion, exactly what your company should be. We knew that this was the most
exciting adventure of our lives. And Dyson knows it would have never happened if he
relinquished total control. From the first sprouting of the idea to research and development,
testing and prototyping, model making and engineering, tooling, production, sales and
marketing, all the way into the homes of the nation. It is most likely to succeed if the original
mule sees it right through. If you make something, sell it yourself.
And so we did, and absolutely nothing went bang. Except, of course, everyone else's market
share. And then he gets into a lot of these great ideas. I just, I told you before, I just absolutely
love his ideas on marketing and sales. He says, my belief is that only the person with the closest
relationship with the product could make a success of it. It is the people who make the thing
that understands them.

Dissatisfaction & Differentiation
Selling anything is about seeing how the product fits into the life of the customer, not about
mouthing off about how great it is. It's about discovering a need and satisfying it. And the way
to best satisfy somebody's need is to have this permanent dissatisfaction with your product. He
says. Later on, if you are this way, guess what? You'll never be able to turn it off. You'll be that
way at work, you'll be that way at home.
You have to use that as an asset. It is not a liability. Have permanent dissatisfaction with your
product. Just because a product appears to be selling well, an engineer must keep on improving.
They must keep feeling permanently dissatisfied. And then he's got a great line about never
being afraid to keep taking risks. You have to risk failure.
That's all experimentation is. But on the other side of successful experimentation is a better
product. That's his whole point. I had discovered the confidence and the stupidity to start doing
things differently. That's great language. You need confidence and stupidity to do things
differently. Because at the beginning, your work is going to suck.
Your work will be bad. More advice on how to get the word out and how to best market and sell
your product. I made editorial comment the basis of all my thinking about publicity. Why one
decent editorial will count for a thousand ads. And then when he does run ads, it's very clear and
straightforward.
The ads are always talking about what need it fills for the customers and how it's different.
Dyson advertising focused on how our products are engineered and how they work, and they
lean into their difference. He's got... This is what I'm about to read to you. One of the most
important two sentences in both books. You know, I don't know, 600, 700 pages I read.

thing that he'll repeat: once you have retained total control, you need to focus only on your
company. One of the things that Dyson's world class at is designing and manufacturing these
And this is what he says: People often ask if we would supply other companies with our motors.
Although it may be profitable to do so, we supply no one else besides ourselves because I want
Dyson engineers to be 100% focused on our next exciting motor development and not on
retrofitting our motors to someone else's product. Back to difference for the sake of difference.
Rather than encouraging different products, working in different ways and achieving different
objectives, we want difference and originality. We don't all want to sing the same song and look
at the same painting. My own heartfelt conviction is difference for the sake of difference. This is
core to his philosophy. I think the way to really think about this is just ask yourself: how can I be
It is a great question to sit and think about. Aim to improve products simply for improvement's

he has in common with a lot of history's greatest entrepreneurs.
No resting on laurels, no sleeping on wins. They make something wonderful and then they do it
again. And if you take some of these ideas and you fall down this path and you don't stop over a
long period of time, a lot can change in a lifetime. This is one of the greatest experiences of
reading these two books back to back.
So remember, go back to his first company he starts, right, that he gets kicked out of. So he's

working on this in his late twenties, early thirties. It's the Ballbarrow. And so they do a photo
shoot for an ad that they're making for the Ballbarrow. They do a photo shoot at this place called
Dodington Park.
Dyson's wife is photographed pushing the Ballbarrow around the grounds for the camera. And
then Dyson says, we could have never guessed then that a quarter of a century later Dodington
Park would be our family home. Family home is a funny way to describe a 300-acre estate where
the main house is 52,000 square feet. He starts out from a place of being in debt and nearly
broke to 25 years later owning the place.
Another idea that Dyson has in common with Elon: Cut out middlemen and those who add no
value. Delete, delete, delete. They also both believe in iterative design. I believe in progress by
stages in the iterative development that I have described as Edisonian. This is such a great way
to describe why this is so important.
It's that persistent trial and error that allows you to wake up one morning after many, many
mornings with a world-beating product. Constant development will result in the end in a better
product. And then he talks about why you don't want to separate design and engineering from
manufacturing. This is exactly what Elon's point was about, not outsourcing manufacturing.
This is what Dyson says: Inventions generate new inventions, ideas generate new ideas.
Opportunities generate new opportunities. The thing about inventing is that it is a continual and
continuous process and it is fluid. Inventions generate further inventions. In fact, that is where
most inventions come from.
They very rarely come out of nothing. I am a great believer in the auto-generation of inventions
out of each other. A kind of asexual reproduction of the product. Gene it is usually when you
actually come to design the product that some of the most interesting things happen. So while
it was the dual cyclone that was the basis of my first vacuum cleaner, as I went on to develop it
over the next dozen years, dozens of other inventions were generated along the way.
Colossus, LLC.
And at the very same time that he is recommending that you adopt this Edisonian principle of
design, the fact that you need to make these small iterations over an insanely long period of
time, that you should only change one thing at a time and see what difference that one change
made. He says ours has neither been a quick nor cheap approach, but it is very valuable.
Investment in new technology requires many leaps of faith and a huge financial commitment
over long periods.
And en route, there are multiple failures, sleepless nights and a great deal of frustration. And
that last sentence is super important. You're not getting around that. You're gonna... This is why
excellence is the capacity to take pain. You have to persevere through multiple failures.
You're gonna have nights you can't sleep and you're gonna be in a lot of pain and frustration.
That is part of the job. Now he has a really interesting idea how to motivate people to persevere
through this. So if he keeps artifacts of great inventions around Dyson's headquarters and as a
reminder of persevering through difficulty.
So, like Frank Whittle's jet engine and the Mini Harrier Jump Jet, this is why he does this. Each
artifact has its own story of against-the-odds progress and lessons on why having faith in your
ideas and believing in progress is so important. What these pieces of history demonstrate is that
it's hard for other people to understand or get excited by a new idea. This requires self-reliance
and faith on the part of the inventor.
I can also see that it's hard for an outsider to understand the challenge and the thrill of inventing
new technology, designing and manufacturing the product, and then selling it to the world. It's
Founders - #400: The Stubborn Genius of James Dyson

fascinating how much of these books he's talking about really emphasizes the importance of
keeping your head in a good place. It is very dangerous to doubt yourself. Outsiders provide
plenty of doubt—you don’t need to add to that pile.
Dyson writes - you have to give the project 100% of your creative energy. You have to believe
that you're going to get there in the end. You need determination, patience, and willpower. The
funny thing about this story is that he says, "I knew it would turn out like this from the very
beginning. Despite all the setbacks and lawsuits and cash crises, the ridicule, the bad feelings,
and all the doubt, I always knew deep down."
One thing that was very beneficial through this decade and a half of crazy struggle, he calls it, is
that you should possess naive intelligence. The way I think about what he's saying is: you should
possess raw, untrained cleverness. He says, "I had various degrees of perseverance underpinned
by a kind of naive intelligence, by which I mean following your own star along a path where you
stop to question both yourself and expert opinion along the way."
The updated subtitle to the second biography is A Life of Learning Through Failure. This is
exactly what he's talking about. You're questioning your initial hypothesis, and you're
questioning what outsiders tell you is or is not possible. He says, "Learning by trial and error can
be exciting. The lessons learned are deeply ingrained. Learning by failure is a remarkably good
way of gaining knowledge. It is part of learning."
You go back to another recurring part of his business-building philosophy: you have to ask
yourself, how can I be different from my competitors? What assets do I have that they cannot
replicate? He says that comes down even to what you name your company. "The company
name was crucial. I was going up against these big multinational companies. My great
advantage in a jungle ruled by faceless conglomerates was that I owned this product myself and
was personally responsible for everything I sold to my customers. So I made it clear in the name

of the company. I intended to design other products too, and they would all be closely identified
Again, what do I have that makes me different from my competitors? He says, "From the get-go,
we were not just going to be a vacuum cleaner company. I knew I was going to design other
products too." That doesn't mean he wasn't focused—it was 17 years before launching a new
Dyson also learned another idea from the great engineers and designers he admired: lightness
as a guiding principle. "We remain a company primarily of engineers, and because of this we
sought to use as little energy or materials as possible to solve every task. Lean engineering is
good engineering. This is something engineers I admired have done since the advent of
powered machinery. For me, lightness, which I define as lean engineering and material
One of my favorite quotes popped in my head when I read that paragraph: "A novice is easily
spotted because they do too much—too many ingredients, too many movements, too much
explanation. A master uses the fewest motions required to fulfill their intention." Charlie Munger
has this great line: "Intense interest in any subject is indispensable if you're really going to excel
in it." Dyson definitely fits into this category.
The people he admires are all obsessive, impractical, product-driven enthusiasts. It's an unfair
advantage if you can maneuver yourself into position where you can just work on what you're
intensely interested in. Many people who get to the top of their fields did exactly this. Car
companies used to be run by people who loved cars—they knew how to make cars themselves
and were always trying to improve them. Retail companies used to be run by people who loved
shops. A hundred years ago, George Safford Parker was nutty about fountain pens. These were

obsessive, impractical, product-driven enthusiasts. This is exactly how I would describe Dyson.
He gives another example: if you're completely obsessed with your product and you never want
to stop improving it, remember, "There's nothing wrong with being persistently dissatisfied or
even afraid. Magic—the unique way a product does what it does—is never to be
underestimated."
Dyson has more advice on hiring. He already said he wanted blank slates—people with unsullied
minds who hadn't picked up bad habits from subpar organizations. He also wanted very
determined people. "You should hire for determination." He gave this example: "Ross was exactly
the sort of dogged, stubborn achiever that we needed. When I first met him, he had been in the
process of building a house at the bottom of a very steep slope. The builders refused to carry
the bricks, claiming it was too difficult and dangerous. So Ross carried every single brick for his
house down the slope by himself, by hand, working steadily every single morning before
showing up for work. This was a man who could build things."
And Dyson adds: "Companies are built, not made." Another idea he shares with Elon Musk:
engineering and design are not separate. "Do not separate them. Designers are as involved in
testing as engineers are in conceptual ideas. At Dyson, we see no barriers between these
disciplines."
He emphasizes - maintain full control over everything. "Always design, engineer, manufacture,
and market your own invention. The ultimate challenge was to design, make, and sell inventive
and wholly new products. To do this, you need to be more than a designer or an engineer. You
need control over the whole process." Just as his role models—the founders of Honda, Citroën,
and Sony—did. He used their ideas over and over again. One way to figure out who you should
admire is to find the person who makes products you absolutely love.
When Dyson was in college, he would ride a Honda Super Cub. He talked about the invention of
the engineer Soichiro Honda, whom he greatly admired for his addiction to the continuous

improvement of products. This sounds just like Dyson. He says of Honda: "I admired him greatly
for his addiction to the continuous improvement of his products," which Dyson himself shares.
Of the Super Cub, Dyson says: "It was simplicity itself to own and ride. This was an early
example of an inventive manufacturer taking an existing product—in this case, the low-cost
motorcycle—and transforming it into a much better and much more attractive proposition than
anything available." Soichiro Honda's genius was to think against the grain while focusing on
continuous improvement, just like James Dyson did after.
Then he talks about another one of his heroes that he mentions over and over again: Alec
Issigonis, who designed the Mini. Alec's view was that market research is bunk and that one
should never copy the opposition. He designed the best-selling British car of all time. If he
believed in market research, it would have never existed.
Now, this is so wild. I told you, I watch all of Dyson's product presentations. I find him very, very
fascinating. And I think his ability to communicate is just very simple and straightforward, easy
to understand. Dyson just gave a demonstration of his new products, and he literally starts the
presentation with why he admires Alec Issigonis and what he learned from how Alec designed
the Mini, and how he used some of those ideas for the new product he just made. How cool is
that? I really hope that you're using ideas that you learned from this podcast half a century later.
That is so cool to me.
Another thing that he says over and over again: he's got an anti-brilliance campaign. He says
encourage employees to be different on principle. The way David Ogilvy says this is that the
beginning of greatness is to be different, and the beginning of failure is to be the same. I think
Founders - #400: The Stubborn Genius of James Dyson

Dyson would agree with that. Dyson says this is part of my anti-brilliance campaign: very few
people can be brilliant. Those who are rarely do anything worthwhile. You are just as likely to
solve a problem by being unconventional and determined as by being brilliant. And if you can't
be unconventional, be obtuse. I don't think I've ever heard this idea anywhere else. And if you
can't be unconventional, be obtuse. Be deliberately obtuse because there are 7 billion people
out there thinking in train tracks and thinking what they've been taught to think. Be a bit wacko.
And you shake people up, and we all need shaking up.
And then I mentioned earlier why one of the benefits of reading his first autobiography—and his
second too, but really his first autobiography—is just he's flat-out hilarious. He just makes you
laugh all the time. And so he was trying to tell us, hey, you can't lead your employees by isolating
yourself from them, so don't do that. But he says it in a very funny way: I am not the sort of
swollen-gutted, belching business luncher that sets off in a limo for four hours of beef and
claret every day at noon and comes back to do little more than gurgle and fart all afternoon. I
eat on site like everyone else.
And then another great thing about him is not only is he funny, but he's very easy to understand.
I remind people on the assembly lines that they need not be in a hurry. Speed is not important,
and neither are numbers. The only thing that is important is doing everything carefully,
thoroughly, and vigilantly. New assembly workers, used to the methods of other manufacturers
in the market, have sometimes become accustomed to a mentality that works at full speed all
day to achieve mere numbers at the expense of care and quality. Again, he's not saying numbers
don't matter. He's not saying speed doesn't matter. He's saying you never, ever sacrifice care
and quality for speed.
In fact, when I met Todd Graves, I got a tour of the very first Raising Cane’s that he opened like
30 years ago. And in the back, where customers can't see, there's a giant sign on the wall that
says exactly this. It says, never sacrifice quality for speed. I try to do this. I aim to make a new
podcast every seven days. When you notice that I am late and I'm not hitting that seven-day

number, it's because the quality isn't there yet. It bothers the hell out of me, but no one's going
to remember if I put a podcast out five days late. You're hopefully listening to this 10 years from
now. No one's going to remember if I put it out five days late. They're going to remember if it
wasn't great. So I love that: never sacrifice quality for speed.
We are never satisfied with the product and are always trying to improve it. We are fascinated to
the point of obsession with the product. And then finally, we get to the point. I'm reading both
books at the same time, rereading both books at the same time. I wasn't sure if I was going to
combine them. That was an unexpected idea. When I got to this part in the second book, I knew
it. This idea and the way he describes this is too important. It had to be both books. And it starts
out with him having a great way to describe what being an entrepreneur actually is.
Ours is a life of challenge and frustration, all of which is a fulfilling pastime. Being an
entrepreneur is not necessarily about making a fast buck. It's about creating new products and
new opportunities, generating rewarding employment and opportunities in the process. It is not
easy. It may be necessary to change, to reinvent your business as circumstances change around
you. Just as you think you have understood a situation and how things work, it changes without
warning. There are traps around every corner.
As soon as Dyson became successful, people asked me when I was going to sell the company.
Once I had made my first million, it was surely time for me to get away from the sweat and
grime and grim routine of the factory and become a reclusive landowner, building duck houses
and cleaning the moat around my castle. Many wise friends advised me to sell when a few offers
came in. A family business has most of its wealth tied up in the business, so continuing to keep
it a family business is both a risk and a responsibility. But I like living on a knife's edge,

competing and building the business. I am passionate about developing new technology and
working with a wonderful and creative team around me.
Those kind people totally missed the point. I didn't work on those 5,127 prototypes or even set
up Dyson to make money. I did it because I had a burning desire to do so. I find inventing,
researching, testing, designing, and manufacturing both creative and satisfying. Going against
established expert thinking was a huge risk. No one could confirm that what we were doing was
a good idea. Everyone, in fact, confirmed the reverse. The data were all against it. If, however,
we had believed the data and had not trusted our instincts, we would have ended up following
the path of dull conformity.
In following a different path, obstacles will be put in the way of pioneering manufacturers. Yet
the process of creativity and of solving seemingly insolvable problems is rather wonderful. It is
hard to be pioneering because you don't know whether or not you're going to succeed. You
have to believe that you will succeed. It is scary. I am scared all the time. Fear, though, can be a
good thing as it pumps the adrenaline and motivates a life of perpetual learning.
Pursuing science, engineering, and technology has been a magical and fulfilling adventure.
Improving products through the application of technology and making them enjoyable and
surprising to use is thrilling for an engineer. The creative impulse, the desire to improve things,
and the need to solve problems are a state of mind that cannot be switched off. It is there all
the time, whether you're at work or at home. It is the intellectual challenge of seeing problems
and developing a product or system that solves them. Scientists and engineers combined
recognize today's problems and are capable of providing new solutions. History has proved this
time and time again.
