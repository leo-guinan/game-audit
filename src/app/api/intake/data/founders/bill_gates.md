Introduction
I want to start with a quote by Bill Gates on Bill Gates. And then I want to tell you this excellent
Larry Ellison quote on Bill Gates that I found. So first, this is Bill Gates on Bill Gates. He says a
key advantage I had was being fanatical. That is taking all of my capabilities day and night and
just focusing on how do you write good software.
I loved being a fanatic. Eventually, I reveled in it. I didn't believe in weekends. I didn't believe in
vacations. For a lot of people, it wasn't an ideal place to work. We were pretty frantic and
demanding.
And then here's the quote from Larry Ellison on Bill Gates. Keep in mind, Larry Ellison and Bill
Gates were very fierce competitors. This is what Larry Ellison said: "Bill Gates is one of the most
remarkable business people I've ever met. Some people say Bill is the most brilliant guy that
they've ever met. There are a lot of really brilliant scientists in our business. Forgive me, there are
a lot of people in the world smarter than Bill Gates.
There are very few people in the world that have his focus and endurance. Someone once said
Bill wants people to think that he is Thomas Edison when he is really Rockefeller. If he was
Edison, he would be less dangerous. He is utterly relentless. He is indefatigable. He is absolutely
focused and he wants it all.
Barry Diller said he is young and he's mean and he's not tired. That's a high compliment coming
from Barry Diller. Bill is tough and he wants it all. And I have incredible respect for that man."
So recently, Bill Gates just wrote an autobiography. It's called Source Code. It covers his early
childhood and his life up until founding Microsoft in a few short years after that. And so
originally, this episode was just going to be about what I learned by reading Source Code.
book by book.
through the world.

So what I decided to do instead is I want to make a How Bill Gates Works episode very similar to
the How Elon Works episode I just did. And so I grabbed all the notes and highlights from
Source Code and four other books that I've read on Bill Gates. And then I stripped away
everything that wasn't his approach to building his company. And so I'm going to go through
So let's start with Source Code. A lot of this that I pulled from Source Code is, you see, one of
the things that the genius things that Bill Gates did is he designed a company that was natural
to him, that benefited from his innate talents and personality. So it says, by the time I was in my
early teens, my parents had accepted that I was different from many of my peers and had come
to terms with the fact that I needed a certain amount of independence in making my way
From a very early age, Bill Gates discovered that he liked being what he said earlier: I was a
fanatic. He liked being obsessed. And fortunately, the school he went to, which is called
Lakeside, had access, which is extremely rare at this point in history, to a computer. Lakeside
had set up a way for students to connect with a big mainframe computer over a phone line. It
was incredibly rare back then for teenagers to have access to a computer in any form.
And so as soon as Bill discovers this, he says, we really took to it. We devoted all of our free time
to writing programs. And he found the perfect activity and hobby that aligned with his innate
personality. He says, programming fit me because it allowed me to define my own measures of
success. And it seemed limitless. The logic, focus and stamina needed to write long,
complicated programs came naturally to me.

I would retreat into my own thoughts. I would picture computer code in my mind. And one of
the things that young Bill Gates is going to discover, many of history's greatest entrepreneurs
did before him, is that constraints are your friend. Small was key. Computers back then had very
little memory, which meant programs had to be leanly written, using as little code as possible, so
not to hog memory.
The famous line, I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have time. It is easier to write
a program in sloppy code that goes on for pages than to write the same program on a single
page. This goes back to an idea that has popped up the last few weeks with you and I when we
talked about James Dyson: believe that lean engineering is good engineering. Elon Musk would
say the same thing. Bill Gates would say the same thing. Lean engineering is good engineering.
Now, what is so fascinating about this is that you will see that Bill also ran his business this way.
He has a visceral, disgusting reaction. He just hates waste and inefficiencies. And one of the
ways this manifested was Bill was obsessed with cost control. And he is constantly hounding
everyone in the company about it. This will come up many, many times in every book that you
read about Bill Gates and Microsoft.
Actually, one of my favorite stories about this is I got to spend a bunch of time with John
Mackey, who's the founder of Whole Foods. And during one of our conversations, John told me
one of the craziest things that anyone has ever said about this podcast because by the time me
and John met, he had listened to over a hundred episodes of Founders. And he told me that if
Founders existed when he was younger, that Whole Foods would still be an independent
company. That since the podcast and all of history's greatest entrepreneurs are constantly
emphasizing the importance of controlling expenses, he would have put more of a priority on it.
Especially during good times, during boom times, it is very natural for a company, and really for
human nature, to just not watch your costs as closely because everything is going so well. That
is something I was talking about with my friend Eric, who's the co-founder and CEO of Ramp.
spend and how doing so gives you a massive competitive advantage.
Ramp.
Early Life
Colossus, LLC.
Ramp is the presenting sponsor of Founders and way before they were the presenting sponsor
of Founders, I had known all the co-founders of Ramp and had spent a bunch of time with them.
They all had listened to the podcast and they picked up on the fact that the main theme, one of
the main themes of Founders is the importance of watching your costs and controlling your
This is something Bill Gates understood intuitively and implemented incessantly. Wait till we get
to these parts. I think it's going to blow your mind. Warren Buffett said that a good manager of a
business should be a demon on costs. Bill Gates was exactly that. And that is a main theme for
The reason that Ramp exists is to give you everything you need to control your spend. Ramp
gives you everything you need to control your costs. They give you easy-to-use corporate cards

efficient organization, which Bill Gates was obsessed with doing. And Ramp does this all on a
single platform. Make history's greatest entrepreneurs proud by going to ramp.com to learn how

So in addition to having a distaste for inefficiency, a distaste for waste, having the ability to
hyper-focus, two other traits of Bill Gates that are present in his early childhood that will never
leave him are very present as he's building Microsoft is the fact that he is ruthlessly competitive
and full of energy. And so he would tell stories in the book in Source Code about the fact that
Founders - #401: How Bill Gates Works

even when he was a kid he had sisters, that they would play all kinds of board games, so
Monopoly, Risk, card games. And he says they had to turn everything into a competitive sport,
that they would buy two copies of the same puzzle and then they'd race to see who would
finish first.
And then he says this other notable early trait was excess energy. And he says, I rocked.
Rocking. While you'll see this in any interviews, there's also a great documentary on Bill Gates on
Netflix where he's constantly rocking. So he says, I rocked rocking while seated, rocking while
standing.
Anytime I got to really thinking about something, rocking was a metronome for my brain, and it
still is. And then another trait that's really important to understand about Bill Gates because
again, all we're talking about is how, what the ideas he used and the personality traits he used to
build his business. He is incredibly combative.
And the first main person that he was combative with was his mother, because she tried to
control him. Bill Gates is unmanageable. And eventually his parents figured this out. He says, "My
parents knew that the rhythm of my mind was different from the other kids. My sister did what
she was told. She played easily with other kids and from the start got good grades. I did none of
these things."
"I was an aggressive, rebellious child." He would be the same kind of founder. "I was described as
hyperkinetic, brainy, contrarian and contemptuous. My teachers and my parents noted at an
early age of what was to come. I channeled intensity into anything that interested me and
nothing that didn't."
Bill Gates lives in binary states. This will pop up over and over again. He's either totally apathetic
or completely obsessed. And one of his first obsessions, like many of history's greatest
entrepreneurs, was reading.

"By elementary school, I was reading a lot on my own at home. I was learning how to learn by
myself. And I liked the feeling of being able to quickly absorb new facts and entertain myself
"When I read, hours flew by. I tuned out the world. I was in my own head. Books were the one
thing my parents never questioned spending money on. One of our greatest treasures was a set
of the World Book Encyclopedia. I read through every volume, A to Z."
Again, I have to point this out. The maxim I have for this is they devour entire shelves. This idea
of reading every single book on a subject, reading entire libraries, reappears over and over again
in these biographies of great people that did great things. Thomas Edison, Winston Churchill,
Elon Musk, Edwin Land, Bill Gates. They devour entire shelves.
If they are interested in a topic, they must. They can't even... I think they're compelled. They
can't even help themselves. They must read every single thing they can get their hands on about

a feeling that the intellectual divide between adults and me had collapsed. My father would later
say that this change happened abruptly. He said I became an adult overnight. An argumentative,
intellectually forceful, and sometimes not very nice adult. I was 9."
A lot of people ask me for a top 10 list. I was, tell me, just give me the top 10 of all the books
that you read and I'll just read your top 10 list. I don't know what that list would look like. All I
know is there's one book on Bill Gates that has to be on that list.
Founders - #401: How Bill Gates Works

One of my favorite books I've ever read is called Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of a
Microsoft Empire. I've read it twice. I've done two episodes on it. And the reason that I'm... And
I'm going to go through a bunch of highlights for you in a little bit on the book.
And one of the reasons I find that book so interesting is because it focuses on Bill Gates' ability
to focus. And he talks about this in source code. He says, "I was very deliberate about what I put
energy into." I think that is a huge difference between people that accomplish great things and
people that want to, but never do. You have to be very deliberate about what you put your
energy into.
"I felt most at home in my own head. I could go days without speaking, emerging from my room
only for meals and school." This got to be such a big problem. They had a therapist, a family
therapist. And it was really... the therapist was there to try to moderate the relationship between
Bill and his mother.
And the reason I bring this up is because there's going to be so many times throughout young
Bill Gates' life where older adults realize, this kid is special, he's got an iron will, and it's just not
going to work. Essentially what happens is the therapist tells his parents, you have to loosen
your grip on him. You are going to break before he does.
And later on in the book, when Bill Gates is already running Microsoft... for this is a different
book. Later on the podcast, I'll tell you about this. He talks about the fact that he's been running
Microsoft at that time for 20-something years. He's, "I don't understand. This is fantastic. Why is
it so rare for people to run a company they founded for multiple decades?" Goes back to that
legendary endurance and focus that Larry Ellison observed him in.
And so this was the end result of family therapy. My father later shared what Dr. Kressy said:
"Give it up," he told my parents. "He's going to win. Ease up. Don't force it. Give your son more
freedom."

high opinion of himself from a young age.
Colossus, LLC.
And so any adult that came in contact with the young Bill Gates... I said, Bill had a lot of innate
self-confidence. He had a high opinion of himself from a young age. I think this is one of the
I absolutely loved Michael Dell's autobiography that I've told you about a million times. I've
listened to the audiobook three times before I made the episode on that book. And one of my
favorite things that Michael Dell shared in the book was the idea that I'm going to try to take on
And he says, "Was I a little full of myself at 19? Sure I was. I think you have to be to do anything
important." Very similar to the line in this book: Bill had a lot of innate self-confidence. He had a
And one of the smartest things that Bill did from a young age is he started consuming a ton...
Just... He said he consumed stacks of biographies and he named some in the book: Franklin
Delano Roosevelt, Douglas MacArthur, Napoleon, Henry Ford, et cetera. He said, "We spent..."
Him and his friend were doing this together. He said, "We spent hours on the phone dissecting
their lives. We analyzed the paths they followed to success with intensity."
Again, he can't do anything... If he's doing anything, he's doing it with intensity. Goes back to his
love of computers and really picking a business that would come naturally to him, one he could
do for many, many decades.
"I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of
mental sloppiness." Again, which really disturbs him. "It demanded that I be logically consistent
and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.

This feedback loop was addictive."
He's 13 at this point in the story. "The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing
programs flowed in from a combination of skills that came easy to me. Logical thinking being
one and an ability to focus intensely for long periods being another."
"Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself. I was an eighth grader,
confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant that I could do anything the
older guys could do, if not better."
The way he ends this paragraph speaks back to his hyper-competitiveness: "I was determined to
not let anyone get anything on me."
Meeting Paul Allen
And so this is when he's going to meet his future... He meets his future co-founder Paul Allen at
Lakeside. Paul Allen's two years older than him. And there's something that Bill Gates says in a
few different books. He was attracted to a field where there's no path, there's no track in front
of you. You kind of have to figure this out for yourself.
And one way he would talk about this later when he was asked to give advice... if we were
starting over, if you're a young person, what would you do today? You obviously wouldn't start
Microsoft today. And he says you should look for virgin territory to identify opportunity. And
that is exactly what we find where we are in the story.
Because he says, "There's no instruction. We knew more than our teachers and we were forced
to try to piece together how to write our first programs on our own." Later on, I'll talk about... we

So he says, "As the weeks went by, a lot of the kids who first played around with the terminal,
the computer, lost interest and drifted away, leaving a small group of hardcore adherents." That

Larry Ellison said about Bill Gates: There are very few people in the world that have his focus and
And I think he is 14 years old when he gives into this obsession and it actually gives him the way
that he is going to work for the rest of his life. There's a great line in that book Hard Drive I just
told you about where it says, everything Bill did, he did to the max. And so there's an example of
that in Source Code because he's working all day at the computer and they have access to this
computer lab at night called C-Cubed (C³). But then he'd be home at 10 o'clock at night and
he's thinking, why am I going to go to sleep? I should just be working on the computer.
So he would sneak out of his room at home, climb out his bedroom window and go and catch
the bus, go into C-Cubed (C³) and work all night on the computer. He says that would be the
first of many nights I sneaked out. And for years after, and this is really important that he did
this. This is one of my favorite lines in the entire book.
He says, a lot of successful people I've met have described how after falling in love with their
chosen field, they had to put in a period of hard, focused work. It's the time in which raw
interest is transformed into real skill that is so important. This period, which was really just about
four months, minted a work style for me that would last for decades. Unconstrained by cost or
time, I'd fall into a zone of total focus.

As fast as I completed a section of a program, I could ask the computer to run it, giving me an
instant answer whether I was right or wrong. Try something, see if it works. If it doesn't, try again
with something different. We couldn't watch YouTube tutorials on the Internet. There was no
Internet, and guidebooks were rare.
Him and Paul Allen are so hungry for knowledge, they would dive in dumpsters. This is the way
to think about this: How bad do you actually want it? How bad do you actually want it? Because
there's somebody out there, like a Bill Gates or a Michael Dell, that wants it deeply and are
willing to do whatever is necessary to get the information they need that would help them
accomplish their goals.
At the end of every day, someone would take out the trash. Included in that trash would be used
computer paper printed with lines of code with whatever the C-Cubed (C³) engineers are
working on that day. At night, when the employees had all gone home, Paul and I went out to
the back of the building to see what we could find in the dumpster. I was 13 years old, learning
on my own terms with a $500,000 machine as my teacher.
And when he says he minted a working style, this is what he means. I'd fall asleep at the terminal
more times than I can remember, my nose meeting the keys for an hour or two. Then I'd wake up
and immediately start coding again. So that is high school. That is Harvard. That is Microsoft.
Everyone who runs into Bill reports seeing him do this. My approach was rapid-fire, in-your-face.
Bill loved conflict when building his company. Another thing that he'll have in common with a lot
of history's great entrepreneurs. I could read, you know, 50 quotes to you about this, but I think
the best quote that describes this is from Jeff Bezos, who also was this way.
If I have to choose between agreement and conflict, I'll take conflict every time. Why? Conflict
always yields a better result. Back to Bill Gates. I was a kid working like a maniac late into every
night. I broke my record for sustained work once, not leaving for nearly 100 hours straight. That
meant not showering and hardly eating for nearly four days.
Colossus, LLC.
And so when you think about why all these founders want conflict, they want conflict because
they want to win. They want improvement. They desperately need to be the best. So I'm
thinking of Steve Jobs, who talked about the benefit of conflict. Jeff Bezos talked about the
benefit of conflict. Bill Gates talks about it.
And so in one case, Bill runs into, he quickly starts becoming the best programmer out of his
group of friends. But then he runs into an older programmer with a lot more experience. And
you'll see his reaction to this. Someone had gone through and corrected my work
schoolteacher-style. The person had completely torn it apart.
He wasn't just fixing issues, but the whole structure and design of what I had written. Normally,
my first reaction would have been to defend myself. If anyone at Lakeside tried to critique my
code, I might snap. No way, you're wrong. But this time, as I sat reading his comments, studying
the code, I thought to myself, oh, wow, this guy is so right.
I had never met anyone as vigilant and sharp about computer coding. He consistently returned
my work with corrections that raised it to levels that I didn't know existed. That is such an
important line. He consistently returned my work with corrections that raised it to levels I didn't
know existed. Norton opened a completely new level to me.
And so this idea that he wants you to push back, he wants to be right. Akio Morita, who I've told
you about a million times, he's the founder of Sony. It's remarkable how many of these people
that we admire, like a Bezos or Jobs or James Dyson, studied Akio Morita and Sony.
And one of the most interesting ideas that Akio Morita wrote about in his autobiography, which
Founders - #401: How Bill Gates Works
Page 6 of 20. © Copyright Colossus, LLC. All rights reserved.
is a book called Made in Japan, was the fact that he believed more companies should hire a paid
critic. And so when Akio discovered this, at the time Sony was making audio equipment. And so
he found somebody that had a very advanced ear, somebody that loved Sony and wanted their
products to be as good as possible. And at the time, he was just a college student.
And so Akio gives him a job, and his job is, hey, we're going to put this new product out and
you're going to rip it to shreds and tell us what and how it can be better. That paid critic that
starts out as a college student eventually becomes the president of Sony. What Akio would tell
you and what Bill Gates is discovering, that you should hire people and you should use tools that
make you better.
One of my partners makes such a tool. Vanta is a very powerful tool to get more sales. Vanta's
value prop is very clear. Vanta helps your company prove that you're secure so more customers
will use your product or service. Many companies won't sign contracts unless you're certified
and this is causing you to lose out on sales.
That is why the average Vanta customer reports a 526% return on investment after becoming a
Vanta customer. You can think of Vanta like an intelligent security assistant that helps your
company pass audits without tons of manual work. So not only do you make more money with
Vanta, but you also save more time.
Manual compliance is slow and painful, and doing everything by hand takes months. The best
companies will not tolerate wasting valuable company time doing something with labor when
technology can automate it. That is a very old and powerful idea that you and I see over and
over and over again in these biographies. Vanta will help you win trust, close deals, and stay
secure faster and with less effort.

that idea.
Colossus, LLC.
Whenever exhaustion took over, I would crash for 12 or more hours fully clothed with my shoes
still on. I repeated this routine for months. And so he, him and Paul are talking about what kind of
business they want to start. And the idea of making hardware never appealed to Bill Gates.
He says, I was increasingly cooling on the idea of building hardware. The business of
manufacturing computers seemed too risky to me. We'd have to buy parts, hire people to
assemble the machines, and find lots of space to pull it off. Software was different. No wires, no
And time again goes back to his early childhood. What does he like to do? He likes to be in a
room by himself, super focused for 36 straight hours. And that is what we knew how to do.
What made us unique. It was where we had an advantage. I believe we could even lead the way,
He wants to pick a field where he can be the absolute best. When he went to Harvard, he
thought, oh, maybe I'll study math.
And then he gets to Harvard and he realizes, oh, there's a lot of people that are better than me
at math, so I need to find a different field to go into. And so the opportunity to start a software
company actually comes because Paul Allen runs into Bill Gates' dorm room at Harvard, and in
his hand he's holding the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics. And it says, for three years,
Paul and I had been talking about how new computers that exploited the exponential
improvement of chips could change everything. On the cover of that magazine was the Altair,
Founders - #401: How Bill Gates Works
Page 7 of 20. © Copyright Colossus, LLC. All rights reserved.
which was a personal computer made by this company out in Albuquerque, New Mexico, called
MITS.
So Paul and Bill decided to cold call Ed Roberts, who's the president of MITS, because Ed
Roberts needs somebody to write software for his hardware. And so Bill says, I explained that
we were almost finished writing a version of BASIC, which is going to be their first product for
the Altair, and we'd like to show it to them. Roberts told me that he'd already gotten calls from
people claiming to have the same software. He said the first person who could produce a
working version would get the deal.
Two important parts of this. One, Bill Gates said they didn't have any software written. He says
we were all faking our way along. And two, the reason I've been hounding on this guy, the way
that Bill works, that he just focuses on the task until it's done. That he's willing to work to the
edge of exhaustion and collapse in his clothes with his face in the keyboard and then jump back
up and go right back to work. This was important many, many years after he developed that
habit because that's exactly what he's going to do to write their version of BASIC. They are
going to get there first.
And so Paul Allen's actually going to move to Albuquerque, start working at MITS. Bill's going to
go back and forth to Harvard. But this is the most important thing. This is the wave that they are
riding. This is why he eventually is going to drop out, because he realized that there is a
technological phenomenon that is going to leave them in the dust if they don't take advantage
of it right now. He says computing had always been a scarce, protected resource, though no
one could fully grasp it at that time. That scarcity was about to give way to plenty and
computers would very quickly be available to millions of people.
And there are all these hints that they're onto something. Here's a hint that you're onto
something. The real die-hard fans drove hundreds and even thousands of miles to Albuquerque

Ed Roberts had the right idea, but he vastly underestimated its popularity. He had forecast that
they might find 800 customers a year willing to shell out the money for their own computer.
Instead, in the first few months, they sold thousands. Again, I have to repeat this because this
just pops up over and over again. It drives me insane that so few people are willing to study
history and learn from human nature. For an innovative product, markets are often larger than

Here's another crazy thing that just blows my mind. I sit here and think about this again. I told
you this before. I don't speed through books or podcasts or anything else. Sometimes it could
be a sentence or a paragraph and I just stare at it and you read it over and over again and you
just stop. You don't go anywhere else and you just think about what the hell is going on, how
important this one paragraph can be. I'm about to read you one.
It is so odd that Bill goes back to the ego and having a lot of confidence that I mentioned that
Michael Dell said and that Bill Gates, everybody around him reported seeing him when he was
earlier. There's something to this, the idea that Bill even thought that you could start a pure

software company. These are the conditions. This is the culture. At the time in which Bill had this
very unusual idea, it was generally accepted that software should be free. Software was
something to be copied from a friend, openly shared or even stolen. It had always been free.
Why shouldn't you give it away?
But Paul and I wanted to build a business. Our conviction arrived at over many late night talks
was that as personal computers got cheaper and cheaper and spread into businesses and
homes, there would be a nearly unlimited corresponding demand for high quality software. That
is the end of the paragraph. How much software in the world on an annual basis is sold now? Do
you know how fucking crazy this is? That paragraph is crazy.
There is no such thing as a pure software company. Your customers don't even believe that your
product should be paid for. Almost nobody has a personal computer. But Bill Gates has belief, he
has conviction. That is why it's dangerous to rush through things and to skip over things. I reread
that paragraph probably 15 times before I just read it to you. It is one of the craziest things to
understand in this story.
And then I told you I've read, I don't know, five other books on Bill Gates. I've never heard him
describe it this way. We wanted to make a software factory. We would provide a broad range of
products that would be regarded as the best in the business. And if things went really well, I
thought that maybe we could have a big team of skilled programmers working for us. Microsoft
was going to be a software factory. We're going to have many, many products. From the jump.
We wanted to get our software on every personal computer in the world. Software companies
didn't exist. Again, this is insane. Our product was something customers thought should be free.
But we had one customer and faith that we could build from there. That one customer is this
tiny little company in Albuquerque, New Mexico in a strip mall surrounded by a check cashing
place and a massage parlor. That is the humble beginnings of what will be one of the most
successful companies ever created.

ass later on. But the deal that they signed with MITS gave them the exclusive rights to sub-

products would have to get the source code, which he describes as the recipe to BASIC,
through MITS and not Microsoft. This is a bad deal. They're going to wind up in a lawsuit over it.
It almost kills Microsoft in the cradle too.
Now I want to go back to this reoccurring theme that Bill Gates wanted to be hardcore. He
wants to be a hardcore person. This is the way he's going to work. He talks about himself out of
everybody, out of his co-founders, out of all the people working at Microsoft, he was the
taskmaster. He was also the one that was so concerned and scared. I was always worried that
we weren't moving fast enough or working hard enough.
As I started this journey into turning our ideas about software into a viable business, I found a
role model in Digital Equipment Corporation's founder, Ken Olsen. He learned as he went and
over time became a master of his business. I reasoned that he and by extension I could pick up
whatever skills and knowledge were needed. So he holds up Ken Olsen as a role model. He's
holding up Ed Roberts. They're embedded inside of MITS and he's saying, oh, we're learning a
ton because this is a really poorly run company.
MITS was at the center of a booming new industry and yet it was a frenzy of confusing
initiatives, half-baked strategies, constantly shifting plans, and ultimately sometimes angry
customers. Even some of the most senior people laid the blame on their boss, Ed Roberts.
And they were frank about why everyone was scared to raise their concerns. It's implied, but not

explicitly stated. Ed Roberts is no Bill Gates. And the problem is he built a company culture
which is the opposite of what most great founders want. They want you to fight back. They will
not respect you if you are a sycophant.
Everybody was scared of Ed Roberts. So therefore what happens? No one tells you the truth.
Everyone except Bill Gates. Ed found Bill Gates very confusing because everybody else is
kissing his ass, and you have this young kid that's getting in his face and yelling at him. He
appeared bemused by my whole affect, the energy and the intensity, my need to hash it out
now personality.
I had excited always on intensity. And he says, I was hardcore from day one. Anytime I wasn't
sleeping, I was coding or writing a letter to drum up business. My mind was locked on the next
step: people to hire, deals to cut, and new customers to find.
And then we already mentioned this earlier. Bill tracked every penny and he goes and rips his co-
founders and the early employees when they fail to do the same. So he writes his business plan
on seven pages. He says, my guiding principle is not getting ahead of ourselves and drowning in
costs. That's the first sentence.
Our two main goals I wrote were number one, grow in size and reputation, and two, make
money. That letter marked the next phase of a concerted effort to establish ourselves as an
independent company. What does he mean by independent company? He has one customer,
they're working very close with them, and it's a crappy run company. We've got to diversify
away from this guy as soon as we can.
Another smart thing Bill did. It worried me that we were still so reliant on MITS, and they start
having these fights. Since MITS held worldwide rights to 8080 BASIC, anytime we found a
customer for the source code, the contract would have to go through MITS. If we signed a deal,
then we had to split the revenues with them. Bill is going to fight back. He's going to get himself
out of this deal.

Another thing that was important to him, he wanted to be around other high energy, intense
people. By then I could instantly recognize other people who emitted my kind of excess energy.
Steve Ballmer had it beyond anyone that I'd ever known. So he wants to be around high energy,
intense people again.
Another way he works, he pays attention to everything. The focus was Microsoft and all the
things that were falling through the cracks: travel expenses, employee oversight, customer
follow-up, and contract negotiations. I groused that they still hadn't lined up a company credit
card. Today, that would be a no-brainer. They just go to ramp.com.
Then it goes back to this letter he's writing them. I wrote we spent $14,000 since I left and not
thinking about cash flow or taking care of the memory royalty is a way to send us down the
tube. For all the talk about hard work and long hours, it's clear that you guys haven't talked about
Microsoft together or even thought about it individually, at least not nearly enough. As far as
putting out our last measure, the commitment just isn't being met.
And when he's commenting on this letter and these talks he's having with the people he's
working with, this is what he says. I've always been the taskmaster, the one who incessantly
worried about losing our lead and fearing that if we weren't careful we'd be sunk. We watched
C-Cubed (C³)d - remember when they were... He was sneaking out at night, taking a bus and
working on the computer. That was a startup he was working at. It was C-Cubed (C³)d.
Says we watched C-Cubed (C³)d go from a promising startup to having creditors drag the
furniture away 18 months later. And we were witnessing the growing trouble at MITS which had
Founders - #401: How Bill Gates Works

the lead but seemed to lack the management rigor to maintain it. This is... It was very interesting
to me how much of the book is talking about how worried he was.
Steve Jobs said that victory in our industry is spelled survival. It's very clear from his actions that
Bill Gates agreed. We knew the core job of developing software. I worried. There's that word
again. I worried we weren't learning everything else fast enough. He's always worried.
And so there's this company that comes in called Pertec. Pertec is going to buy MITS for $6
million. And at the time it looked like one of the worst things that could happen to Microsoft
winds up being the best. Because what happens is after they buy, everything Microsoft related
stopped completely.
So Pertec stops paying Microsoft royalty payments. The licensing deal stopped. They refused to
sell ROM BASIC to any other company. They were making no efforts to sell our software and
they were blocking deals even as more and more companies were soliciting us. This is going to
cause the lawsuit.
Now there's another sentence in the book Hard Drive that I told you about earlier that is one of
my favorite descriptions of a young Bill Gates. And it talks about this lawsuit because, you know,
Ed Roberts sold his company to Pertec, but he had warned them about Bill Gates is not this
average dude. He's not just some little 21-year-old punk.
Roberts had warned Pertec that it would have its hands full with Gates, but no one listened to
him. Pertec kept telling me I was being unreasonable and they could deal with this guy. Roberts
said it's a little like Roosevelt telling Churchill that he could deal with Stalin.
And so this idea that I've already repeated a few times, that he just pays attention to every little
detail, he was the one that had negotiated the contract with them to begin with. And so he says,
it became increasingly clear to me that Pertec had no intention of paying us back royalties or
sub-licensing the 8080 BASIC to any other companies. Yet now I wondered if they had even
read our contract.
Colossus, LLC.
We didn't transfer ownership of the software to MITS, we licensed it to them and they were
obligated by the contract to make its best efforts to sub-license the software to other
companies. This is really, really important. When a company agrees to make its best efforts, it
agrees to do everything in its power to make good on whatever is stipulated in contract.
I said we agreed to the exclusive license if MITS agreed to make best efforts to license our
source code. Their lawyers pushed back saying that nobody agreed to best efforts. They would
consider instead the term reasonable efforts. But I wouldn't agree. So he wouldn't sign the
contract unless the best efforts was in the contract. This is again years before they're fighting in
the lawsuit that was so important. Best efforts it was. That decision is going to save Bill Gates'
ass later.
And so he says our central challenge was to convince the arbitrator that, number one, many
companies wanted to license our product. Number two, Pertec and MITS was blocking those
licenses when they were contractually obligated to make their best efforts at facilitating them.
They almost ran out of money. This is again why Bill Gates is so... He was so focused on this. He
wanted a one-year buffer.
He says, we're going to have enough money in our bank account that if no one pays us for a
year, we are going to survive. And so the arbitrator sides with Microsoft. He terminated our
exclusive license with MITS, clarifying definitively that we owned our source code. We
immediately called all the companies that had been waiting for the software. Within weeks we
had money coming in from five or six clients.

And then it goes back to the importance of having this hardcore focus. Like one of those
watertight hatches on a submarine, I could shut out the rest of the world. Driven by the sense of
responsibility I felt for Microsoft, I had closed the hatch door and locked the wheel. No
girlfriend, no hobbies. It was the one way I knew to stay ahead, and I expected similar dedication
from others.
Meeting Steve Ballmer
We had this huge opportunity in front of us. Why wouldn't you work 80 hours a week in pursuit
of it? Yes, it was exhausting, but it was also exhilarating. I needed a 24-hour-a-day business
partner. He's realizing that Paul is not... He's not going to be his long-term partner. A peer who
would hash out and argue through big decisions with me. Someone who would pour over
scribbled lists of which customers might or might not pay and discuss what our bank account
would look like as a result.
Steve Ballmer joined in 1980 and became the 24-hour-a-day partner I needed. And so the book
source code ends when they relocate from Albuquerque to Washington. And so he's driving
back. And I think this is one of the most important things that again reappears over and over
again in these biographies, in these autobiographies. When you have extreme success like Bill
Gates has had, there's no way that they could have possibly predicted the scale of their
success.
He has no idea what is ahead of him. It wasn't just me moving back. It was Microsoft, the
company that a friend and I had co-created with that motley group of employees and a growing
profitable business, and which from that point on would be an integral part of who I was. My
path was set. I could hardly imagine how far it would take me.
So Bill is going to write two more autobiographies. The second one is going to be focused on
building Microsoft. Obviously when that comes out, I will read and make an episode on it
immediately. And the third one will be on his philanthropy and his foundation.

to talk to us cannot tell a story.
Colossus, LLC.
So what I'm going to do now is just pull out a couple other ideas and highlights from four other
books that I read on Bill Gates. And the first book is Hard Drive: Bill Gates and Making the
Microsoft Empire. Still my favorite book that I've ever read on Bill Gates. The storytelling in that
book is absolutely phenomenal. And it's because of the phenomenal storytelling that the ideas
This is a very important theme that recurs over and over again, the fact that people buy stories.
Steve Jobs said that storyteller is the most powerful person in the world. Valentine, founder of

in it. And you can do that by going to collateral.com.
And so the first highlight from Hard Drive that I'm going to talk to you about is the fact that by
1990, remember they're having these, starting Microsoft, late 70s, 76, 77. They're saying, you
know, we want to make a pure software company, but all our customers think it should be given
away for free. There's no such thing at the time.
Well, by 1990, Microsoft had become the first software company in history to sell more than a
billion dollars worth of software in a single year. There's a great quote from Bill Gates in Hard
Drive. He says, "I can do anything I put my mind to." Bill was 11 when he said this.
Everything Bill did, he did to the max. What he did always went well beyond everyone else.
Everything he did, he did competitively and not simply to relax. He was a very driven individual.
The computer triggered a deep passion and an obsession in him. He devoured everything he
could get his hands on concerning computers and how to communicate with them, often
teaching himself as he went. It was often after midnight when he finished his work.
"It was when we got free time that we really got into computers," Bill said. "I mean, then I
became hardcore. It was day and night." So keep in mind when he's saying that he's describing a
point of his life when he was 13 years old. And again he's using his favorite word, hardcore.
This is the way that his friends in high school and college would describe him. He was sure of
himself. He was aggressively, intimidatingly smart. He didn't have any social graces. He was one
of those guys who knew he was smarter than everyone else and he knew he was right all the
time.
He was hard-nosed, confrontational. His intensity would boil over into raw, unthrottled emotion.
He had a sense of adventure. He was a risk taker, a guy who liked to have fun and who was fun
to be with.

He had an immense range of knowledge and interest and could talk at length on any number of
subjects. He also knew that he wanted to be rich. Although Bill did not know what he was going
to do with his life after high school, he seemed confident that whatever he would do would
He had made such a prediction about his future on several occasions. "I'm going to make my
first million dollars by the time I'm 25." It was not said as a boast or even a prediction. He talked
about the future as if his success was predestined, as if it was a given. As certain as the
Bill Gates would later tell a friend that he went to Harvard to learn from people smarter than he
was and left disappointed. One of the books that I have a bunch of highlights about Bill that I
want to share with you is actually Paul Allen's autobiography, but it's really interesting.
Paul Allen and his mom are in this book Hard Drive and Paul Allen's mom would warn her son
about Bill Gates. He said that he was an edge walker. This is an example of that. Gates would fall
asleep in class, which was not surprising. He was living on the edge.
It was not unusual for him to go as long as three days without sleep. His habit was to do 36
hours or more at a stretch, collapse for 10 hours, go get a pizza and then get back at it. And if
that meant that he was starting at 3 o'clock in the morning, then so be it.
Bill had a monomaniacal quality. He would focus on something and really stick with it. He had a
determination to master whatever it was he was doing. Bill was deciding where he was going to
put his energy into. Hell with what anyone else thought.
Founders - #401: How Bill Gates Works
Page 13 of 20. © Copyright Colossus, LLC. All rights reserved.
And what's interesting is how much Bill needed Paul Allen to push him over the edge. I don't
think Bill Gates would have dropped out of Harvard without Paul Allen. And Paul Allen was a lot.
He had broader interests than Bill. Bill just wanted to make software and sell software and do
that forever.
And so I thought it was really funny is that Paul Allen actually quotes Shakespeare to convince
Bill that now is the time to start their own company and that it has to be right now or we're
going to miss it. And this is the quote from Shakespeare that Paul Allen read to Bill Gates.
"There is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune. Omitted all the
voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat and
we must take the current when it serves or lose our venture."
Gates knew Allen was right and that the personal computer miracle was going to happen. And it
was going to happen with or without them. Now I already mentioned this a few times, but I think
it's again really important to reiterate. Not a lot of people know how cautious Bill Gates was with
Microsoft's money.
He wanted a one year buffer. He didn't need to raise venture capital. Microsoft was a money
printing machine then and now. He was financially conservative and that was the way he
intended to run his company. There would be no unnecessary overhead or extravagant spending
habits at Microsoft.
Bill's Vision
And he had giant goals from day one. Bill always had the vision from the time that I met him that
Microsoft's mission in life was to provide all the software for microcomputers. And it goes back
to his preference to keep it lean. You just need a small group of ridiculously smart people.

a year.

The way they would describe the early employees at Microsoft, they called them Micro Kids.
Part of what made Microsoft so successful during the company's infancy was the team of
programmers that Gates and Allen began to assemble in the spring of 1976. They became
known as the Micro Kids. They were high IQ insomniacs who wanted to join the personal
computer crusade. Kids with a passion for computers who would drive themselves to the limits
This was one of the most surprising things when I read this book for the first time: just how lean

Bill prioritized sales over everything else. What sustained the company was not Bill's ability to
write programs. Bill sustained Microsoft through tireless salesmanship. For several years he
alone made the cold calls and haggled, cajoled, browbeat and harangued the hardware makers,
convincing them to buy Microsoft services and products.
He was the best kind of salesman there is. He knew the product and he believed in it. He

approached every client with the zealotry of a true believer. He was also hell-bent on moving
fast and one tactic he used to move fast is you have to prioritize personal performance over
management.
Here's an example of that. Gates came into Smith's office one day and shouted at him. "How
can you possibly take this much time working on this contract? Just get it done." Smith recalled
of this short but educational meeting with his much younger boss. "I think what I realized was
that I needed to focus that the money and the opportunities were simply there and I needed to
close contracts with customers. So I focused on personal performance over management.
Initially I was dealing more with management issues as a guy with an academic background
coming out of a large company. But it took me a couple of meetings to realize that personal
performance was what mattered."
This is another mind-blowing stat. This is Bill Gates describing what Microsoft looked like when
they had just 30 employees. "When we got up to 30 employees, it was still just me, a secretary
and 28 programmers. I wrote all the checks, answered the mail, took the phone calls." Another
great idea. Bill overcame his weakness that he looked young by relying on his strength, which
was his mind and the passion that he had for his work.
And so one of their early customers describes coming to the office one day. He says, "When
someone came out to take us back to his office, I thought the guy who came out was the office
boy. It was Bill. Well, I'll tell you, by the time you were with Bill for 15 minutes, you no longer
thought about how old he was or what he looked like. He had the most brilliant mind that I ever
dealt with and he was absolutely ruthless."
Bill believed that if you lost a $50,000 contract, he considered it $100,000 loss because
Microsoft lost the 50 and his competitor gained the 50. Gates wanted to eliminate his
opponents from the playing field. Bill learned early on that killing the competition is the name of
the game. There just aren't as many people later to take you on. In game theory, you improve
the probability you're going to win if you have fewer competitors.
Colossus, LLC.
And Bill would relentlessly study his competitors. If you talk to Bill about any software company
or any hardware company, there's a very high probability that he'll be able to tell you who the
CEO is, what their revenues were last year, what they're currently working on, and what the
problems are with their products. He is very, very knowledgeable, and he prides himself on
knowing what's going on in his industry. This combination of ambition and wanting to win every
single day is what Bill Gates referred to as being hardcore.
And so I mentioned earlier that Microsoft did not need VC. In a carefully planned move that had
been under discussion for some time, Bill sold 5% of Microsoft for a million dollars. Can you
imagine 5% of Microsoft for a million dollars to TVI, which is Technology Venture Investors.
Microsoft did not need the venture capital. Gates was essentially hiring the firm's expertise.
There's a great line that I'll share with you later from this interview from 1997 that Bill talks
about: that the money they raised in the IPO that they never touched, they just put it in the
bank and it's still sitting there with the other $5 billion that Microsoft has. So he really prided
himself on just making not only a phenomenally financially efficient company and one that just
absolutely printed cash. And I absolutely loved what he said about this because he knew that
Microsoft had to go public, but he didn't want to. And a year before they go public, he said, "All
I'm thinking and dreaming about is selling software, not stock."
And so that leads us to the third book that I talked about, which is actually the sequel from Hard
Drive. It's called Overdrive. It's not a great book. I mean, it's not bad. I guess maybe you want to
read it once. Honestly, I don't even know. Maybe not read it once. Maybe just reread Hard Drive
a second time is probably a better use of your time.
Founders - #401: How Bill Gates Works

But there are just a handful of ideas in here that I do think I want to pull out. And I think it's
interesting because now we've fast-forwarded in Microsoft's history and we see that this focus
and intensity is still there. Neither marriage nor fame nor fortune had diminished the white-hot
competitive fire that consumed him. And so one of my favorite parts of this book is just again, it
goes into this ruthless competitive drive that Bill Gates had.
This is how a competitor described Bill. This guy named Philippe Kahn. Philippe would later say,
"Gates looks at everything as something that should be his. It can be an idea, market share, or a
contract. There is not an ounce of conscience or compassion in him. The notion of fairness
means nothing to him. The only thing he understands is leverage."
And again, the reason I bring that up, obviously your competitors are probably not going to say
nice things about you, right? But the important thing is Bill liked to fight. And you can actually
learn a lot about his personality because he would, he was giving interviews back then and he's
in the middle of the fight. And so he would describe what he called his disgruntled competitors.
This is from an interview that Bill gave to a major publication. "Lotus lost ground because it was
very late in catching the two biggest technology waves, the Macintosh and Windows. Borland
International is too distracted with his bad merger. Philippe Kahn is good at playing the
saxophone and sailing, but he's not good at making money. WordPerfect is truly a one-product
company. Our most successful software is for the Macintosh. We have a much higher market
share on the Mac than anywhere else. And how does Apple help us? Will they sue us in court in
the future? Maybe our competitors will decide to become more competent."
Deep competitive fires drove Bill Gates. Goes back to this insane level of focus. For many years,
Gates had refused to even own a TV, preferring instead to spend his time reading books and
magazines. There's a great story told by Michael Moritz where he's interviewing Bill Gates and he
tells the story. He's "Oh my God, somebody broke into your car and stole your radio." And Bill's
"No, they didn't. I took that out myself."
Colossus, LLC.
And Bill says something "You know, from my house to the office is a seven-minute drive from
the office to the airport. It's an 11-minute drive." And then he does his math of how much time is
in the car between the office and his house and the airport. He's "You know, that's an extra five
hours a month where instead of listening to music, I can just be thinking about Microsoft."
Another interesting and I would say smart idea that Bill had. He would keep a list of mistakes and
it was a top-10 list and he'd reread that to make sure they don't make the same mistakes in the
future. Now, I have not read Overdrive in probably, I don't know, four years I would guess. But
even though it's been that long, this is the one story in the book that I have never forgotten. It's
one of the craziest stories I've ever heard.
For years, Bill Gates had Philippe Kahn in his sights. In the mid-1980s, when Borland's Turbo
Pascal—this is Kahn's company—was blowing away Microsoft's competing product, Gates held
meetings that became known around Microsoft as the Borland War Councils, during which he
and his staff plotted how to beat the Frenchman, being Philippe Kahn. Gates reportedly walked
into one such meeting and threw Kahn's picture down on a table and said, "How can I get rid of
this guy?" They would pass out t-shirts that read, "Delete Philippe."
But this is by far the craziest story in the book. Philippe Kahn recalled that he had once found Bill
Gates at an industry conference in the late 1980s, sitting alone in a corner, looking at a
photograph in his hands. Philippe walks up to Bill Gates and Philippe says, "It was a picture of
me." That is one of my favorite Bill Gates stories because it's just such a hardcore crazy thing to
do. Bill Gates' burning desire to win and fear of failure compel him not only to beat his
competitors, but to destroy them.

Okay, so that leads us to Paul Allen's autobiography that he wrote shortly before he died. It's
called Idea Man. As you can imagine, there's a bunch of interesting stories and anecdotes about
Bill Gates in it. I mentioned this earlier—the fact that Bill lived in binary states. He was either
bursting with nervous energy, drinking a dozen Diet Cokes a day, or he was completely dead to
the world. He'd work until drained, and then curl up on the floor in his office and be asleep
within 15 seconds. Sometimes I'd return in the morning and see Bill's feet sticking out of his
office doorway.
Bill and Paul were very different. And I think there's a story in Michael Dell's autobiography that's
similar to the story that's told in Paul Allen's autobiography in the sense that Michael had an
older, more experienced person that he hired to be president of Dell. And the guy only lasted
four years. He said by the time—and this is very early history of Dell—by the time four years
was up, his back hurt. He had stomach problems. He was losing all his hair. He was just dying.
And he said, "This distress is literally killing me." And Michael's bouncing to the office every day.
He's super excited.
It's exactly the same with Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Obviously Bill playing the role of Dell and Paul
Allen playing the role—I think the guy's name was Lee Walker—but he talks a little about this.
Microsoft was a high-stress environment because Bill drove others as hard as he drove himself.
He was growing into a taskmaster who would prowl the parking lot on weekends and see who
made it in.
In addition to rereading the source code and then all my highlights and everything from these
other five books, I also watched a documentary on Bill that I mentioned earlier. It's on Netflix,
and Bill would go out and memorize the license plates of the cars in the Microsoft parking lot in
the early days. That's what he's talking about.
And one thing that Bill would do is he never thought it was good enough. You should always be
pushing. You should always be pushing. So it says Bob Greenberg once put in 81 hours in four

days, Monday through Thursday. When Bill touched base towards the end of Bob's marathon, he
asked him, "What are you working on tomorrow?" Bob said, "I was planning to take the day off."
And Bill said, "Why would you do that?" He genuinely couldn't understand it. He never seemed
Bill liked to hash things out in intense one-on-one discussions. He thrived on conflict and he
wasn't shy about instigating it. A few of us cringed at the way he would demean people and
force them to defend their positions. If what he heard displeased him, he'd shake his head and
say sarcastically, "Oh, I suppose that means we'll lose the contract. And then what?" And if you
hadn't thought through your position or Bill was just in a lousy mood, he'd resort to his classic
Bill came on as a force of nature. Bill liked it when someone pushed back and drilled down with
him to get to the best solution. He wouldn't pull rank to end an argument. He wanted you to
overcome his skepticism and he respected those who did.
And then I love this comparison of Bill Gates from Paul Allen. "I've seen just one other person up
close who compared to him who wanted not only to beat you but to crush you if he could.
Those two stood apart for raw competitiveness." That was Bill Gates and Michael Jordan. And
then it goes back to this just relentless focus. He knew bits and pieces of popular culture, but he
was thinking about the software business first, second and third.
And then I'm so glad I reread my highlights of this book because I had forgotten this. So Ross
Perot tried to buy Microsoft in 1979 for, quote, "mid-seven figures." And this is what Bill Gates
said. Bill Gates said, "No, I want to remain independent." Now keep in mind Microsoft's revenue
that year was just $2.4 million.

When I reread that, I thought about this conversation I had with this founder. So a lot of people
ask me—they think because I've done all this reading, I have some kind of predictive ability,
which I don't believe I have. What are the young founders now that are going to be one of the
greats? And I don't believe I have any kind of predictability. Time will tell. But there is one person
that I've gotten to know that just gives me young Bill Gates vibes and it's the founder of
Cognition. His name is Scott Wu.
And many people in the tech industry will know who Scott is. Many people out of it will not. And
if you're one of the people that don't, I would definitely look into him and just pay attention to
his career. He's still young, he's still in his twenties, and he's running one of the most important
AI companies today. And so I absolutely love that little piece of Microsoft trivia. It's "Nope, we're
not selling the company for a couple million dollars."
So then Paul goes into Bill's thinking on their most important deal in the early days, Microsoft,
which obviously there's a deal with IBM that's been covered over and over again. So I don't want
to rehash that. I just do want to tell you how they think, how they thought about it and Bill's
really great decisions that he was making. Around this time, says Bill and I were willing to forego
per-copy royalties if we could freely license the DOS software to other manufacturers. This was
our old strategy for the Altair BASIC.
Already enmeshed in antitrust litigation, IBM readily bought this non-exclusive arrangement.
They'd later be slammed for giving away the store. But few people at the time discerned how
quickly the industry was changing. And no one, including us, foresaw that the IBM deal would
ultimately make Microsoft the largest tech company of its day or that Bill and I would become
wealthy beyond our imagining.
Paul continues. Microsoft's biggest asset wasn't the version that we'd made specifically for IBM
PCs. The real bonanza was the compatible system that we called MS-DOS, the product that
could be sold over and over again worldwide under our own name to companies that would
follow IBM's flying wedge into the 16-bit market. It is a product that they bought from this
company called Seattle Computer Products.
a free and clear DOS, a very valuable asset.
it.

So Microsoft is going back and forth with Seattle Computer Products on this. And this part is
really interesting because they're willing to license to customers, but they want to buy from
suppliers. We proposed an outright purchase which they say no to when customers ask to
outright purchase their software. And that was a sales agreement that we signed with Seattle
Computer Products. That contract laid the foundation for what Microsoft would become. It was
And as I stated in a deposition sometime later, Bill was very adamant. This is the most important
part. This is why I just read this entire section to you. This is the part that you should remember.
Bill was very adamant that we should make the contract an agreement of sale. Bill thought we
should have complete ownership and control of the product. He felt it was always better if you
wanted to control and benefit from the evolution of a product to own it as compared to license
Paul then gives us insight into how Bill hired. Bill thought it was better to get programmers when
they were young and enthusiastic, before they were ruined by working somewhere else. We
wanted freshly minted bachelor's degrees above all. We were after the brightest lights. A great
programmer can outproduce an average one by 10 to 1, but with a genius, the ratio might be 50
And then Paul talks about the different way that he saw Microsoft compared to Bill. Bill saw
Microsoft as a part of himself. Paul had other interests. Bill so utterly identified with Microsoft
that he'd get confused about where the company left off and he began.

No Resting on Laurels
By the late 1990s, Microsoft was the largest and most profitable software company in history,
growing at the same rate as the personal computer industry—very rapid growth. Yet Bill saw the
glass as 7/8 empty again. Another thing that Bill shares with almost all of history's greatest
entrepreneurs: no resting on laurels, no sleeping on wins.
Make something great and then do it again. They are never, ever satisfied. And they all also do
the following: Bill was rigorous about weeding out underperformers.
Okay, so then the last book that I want to talk to you about is a book that I've told you over and
over again that everybody should buy. It's incredible. I think it's episode 208 of Founders—
might be episode 204. It's called "In the Company of Giants."
Two Stanford MBA students wrote it back in '97. They interview 16 technology company
founders, and the book is just the transcripts of the interviews, edited. It's incredible.
So all the words you're about to hear are just Bill Gates in '97. And at this point, Bill has 20,000
employees and a net worth of around $20 billion. He says, "Everyone else doing hardware and
software, we focused just on software. That was our advantage."
"The insight to do a dedicated software company was key because other companies like Wang
or DEC or IBM, who had lots of software expertise, didn't have that vision. They didn't treat their
software skill as a key business."
And then he talks about one of the main benefits he had, and that led to a lot of early success
with sales. There's this idea that you have to know what you compete with, not just who. So let
me give you a little background here.
That maxim came from this guy named Herb Kelleher, who was the founder of Southwest
the state of Texas.
bump up the price a little bit."

Airlines. Southwest Airlines was the most successful airline in history. It was profitable for 40
straight years, and it was originally started just to be an airline that was only going to operate in
And so Herb Kelleher tells this great story in one of the books I read on him where you'd have
one of his investors come up to him saying, "Hey, you should raise your prices. Your competitor
is selling a flight from, let's say, Austin to Houston for $80. We're charging $16. Certainly we can
And Herb was adamant. He's like, "No, you don't understand. You think I'm competing with XYZ
Airline? I'm not competing with them. My real competitor is ground transportation. You think
you know who we're competing with, and I'm telling you what we're competing with."
And so Bill Gates talks about this. In the early days, our sales approach was to say, "If you had to
write the software in-house, your fixed engineering budget would be X amount of dollars, and
Microsoft's price is less than half of X dollars. We competed against in-house engineering
budgets, and what you got from us was more powerful than if they had done it themselves."
And then he goes back into that key insight that he made 20 years previously. "Software is a
very unusual business. The development work is not that capital intensive. The first year, we
generated cash like mad, even though we had many customers who went bankrupt. In other
words, we had a wide margin for error."
"I always wanted to have enough money in the bank so that if nobody paid us for a year, we
would be okay." And he was still like that. He says, "The money we got from going public is in the

bank, along with another $5 billion."
And then I mentioned this already once, but I think it's important to repeat. "I used to have this
memo that I updated every year called the 10 Great Mistakes of Microsoft. Many of our mistakes
relate to the markets we didn't get into as early as we should have. But the constraint was
always the number of people we could hire, how to manage everything, and then ensuring
everything that we made met all of our delivery commitments. We were always on edge."
I think that's something I should have told you multiple times. It's in all these books. Bill Gates
would—if you actually read between the lines of what he's saying—"We're always on edge." As
your company scales, everything's going to feel like it's broken. Everything feels like it's going to
be late. Everything is going to feel like it's not good enough.
He's 20 years in—21 years, I think—into his company, and he still feels that way. He reiterates
this idea that everything's going to be slightly uncomfortable a little later on in the interview. "It
was a real challenge because the demand for our capabilities exceeded what we could do."
Everything—Bill sees the glass as always 7/8 empty. Bill says, "We never talk about the things
we've been successful at. We always talk about the challenges ahead. There is no finish line. You
will never go into a Microsoft meeting and hear somebody say, 'We won.'"
And that sense of urgency—no resting on laurels—something he talks about again. "Large
companies are never easy to maintain at a high level of excellence. It becomes the daily task."
There is a huge—this is remarkable because I mentioned, even with 20,000 employees and a
$20 billion net worth at this point, Bill knew that it was just the beginning. Listen to what he says
here. This is 1997: "There is a huge business out there in terms of getting to the market potential.
It's all in front of us."
"We're a software company, and we think software will continue to be valuable. There's an
opportunity to make about $55 billion out there." And even that—Bill Gates couldn't have

predicted what Microsoft's going to be doing 20, 30 years later. Last year's revenue was
something like $280 billion.
So he says there's an opportunity to make about $55 billion out there. "Great software will
become more valuable. You must keep the main thing the main thing—we sell software, not
stock. My job is the best job. I am more committed to my job than most."
"Nobody is going to get me interested in some other job or activity. There's a big difference
between myself and a lot of the people who fade away. They just aren't as interested in what
the next stage requires and fitting into the role it requires."
In terms of starting a company and running it 21 years later, it's surprising that this is not more
common. And I love what he says here: "I've always rejected the term entrepreneur because it
implies that you're an entrepreneur first and a software creator second. I didn't say, 'Oh, I'll start
a company. What will it be? Cookies? Bread? Software?' No, I'm a software engineer and I
decided to gather a team together."
"That team grew over time, built more software products, and did whatever was needed to drive
that forward. You've got to enjoy what you do each day for itself and for its excellence."
And then one of the questions he was asked was about his very aggressive reputation with
competitors and other people in the industry. And his answer was: "What's aggressive? Shipping
a good product—that's aggressive. Lowering the price of the product so more people can get it
—that's aggressive. Those are good things. We're here making good products, taking all the
phone calls, meeting with users, hiring smart people. That's all our business is."
