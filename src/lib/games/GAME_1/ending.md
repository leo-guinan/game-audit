# Resolution + Next Steps

---

All godhood is temporary.

This isn't cynicism. It's physics. The domain shifts. The context changes. The world that made you relevant evolves into a world where your relevance fades. What was insight becomes common knowledge. What was edge becomes baseline. What was you becomes wallpaper.

You can fight this. Most gods do. They cling to their position, extract value from residual attention, become gradually irrelevant while pretending nothing has changed. They block the path for whoever would come next.

But there's another way.

**The god's final move isn't to hold on. It's to elevate.**

You have something that took years to build: attention, trust, the ability to point at something and have people look. While you have it, it feels like yours. But it was never yours. It was just flowing through you for a while.

The question is: **what do you do with it before it fades?**

Elevation means recognizing the next genuine emergence—not the best performer, not the most ambitious climber, but someone who is actually becoming something—and **transferring your trust explicitly**.

"This person. Pay attention to them."

This is different from networking, or mentorship, or even endorsement. Those are exchanges. **Elevation is a transfer.** You're not building relationship. You're handing off the light.

It costs you. Your attention is finite. Pointing at someone else means pointing away from yourself. The spotlight doesn't expand—it moves.

But here's what you get in return: **completion.**

The alternative is a slow fade. Metrics declining. Relevance eroding. Increasingly desperate attempts to recapture what's already gone. Everyone sees it. Everyone pretends they don't.

**Elevation is how you end while you're still alive.** How you choose the ending instead of having it happen to you. How you turn your death into someone else's birth.

And after?

You might disappear. Step back entirely. Become a dog again, anonymous, free to explore without the weight of expectation.

Or you might find yourself becoming something new. The space that was frozen starts to thaw. Without the pressure to perform the old god, a new one might have room to emerge.

**The cycle continues.** Dog becomes god becomes frozen god becomes death becomes elevation becomes... dog again. Or retirement. Or something else entirely.

The point is: **the cycle is the health.** When gods elevate, dogs can rise. When dogs rise, the network stays alive. When the network stays alive, there's room for everyone to become.

Hoarding attention is how systems die.

**Elevation is how they live.**
