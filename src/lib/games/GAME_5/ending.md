# Resolution + Next Steps

---

The Meaning Game is the most powerful game and the most ethically complex.

**Powerful** because meaning shapes reality. The person who interprets doesn't just describe the world—they construct how people see it, navigate it, respond to it.

**Ethically complex** because that power can't be avoided. You can't interpret without shaping. You can't shape without responsibility. And the consequences of your shaping often exceed your intentions.

Now that you can see the game:

- **If you're a Reluctant Oracle:** Speak provisionally. Silence has consequences too.
- **If your Frames get Weaponized:** Design for interpretation. Anticipate misuse. Correct publicly.
- **If you feel like an Empty Prophet:** Name the doubt. Offer process, not just product. Uncertainty is honest.

The Meaning Game, played well, produces **orientation without control**. You help people see without telling them what to do with their sight. You construct frames while acknowledging they're constructions. You speak with authority while welcoming challenge.

That's the balance. Not pretending you don't have power. Not abusing the power you have. **Using it carefully, humbly, in service of others finding their own meaning.**
