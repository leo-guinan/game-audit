# The Cycle

*Observe → Interpret → Narrate → Canonize → Shatter → Reobserve*

Here's the map of the Meaning Game:

**The progression:**

- **Observe** → You encounter events. Confusion. The raw material that needs interpretation.
- **Interpret** → You create a frame. A way of seeing that makes the chaos legible.
- **Narrate** → You share the interpretation. The frame becomes available to others.

**Then the fork:**

- **Reluctant Oracle** → You see but don't speak. The power is hoarded or avoided.
- **Weaponized Frame** → You speak and lose control. The power is captured by others.
- **Empty Prophet** → You speak without conviction. The power is performed but hollow.

All paths eventually lead to canonization or shattering. Interpretations either become accepted frames (canonized) or they break against reality and have to be rebuilt. The meaning that worked stops working. The frame that clarified starts obscuring.

And then? New observation. New confusion. New interpretation. The cycle continues.

The Meaning Game is won by those who **hold their frames lightly**—committed enough to be useful, provisional enough to be correctable, humble enough to accept when it's time to rebuild.
