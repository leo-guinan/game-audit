The Network Game is the most generous game and the most easily exploited.

**Generous** because the value you create benefits others by design. You're building bridges. You're reducing friction. You're making possible things that couldn't happen without you.

**Exploited** because the generosity is easy to abuse—by others who take without reciprocating, and by yourself when you give without sustaining.

Now that you can see the game:

- **If you're a Leaky Hub:** Build containers. Your generosity needs structure to survive.
- **If you're an Indispensable Node:** Make yourself unnecessary. Your freedom requires letting go of control.
- **If you're an Isolated Connector:** Build value first. Your network will form around what you create.

The Network Game, played well, looks like this: **you build infrastructure that makes connection possible, you position yourself to benefit from the network's health, and you know when to step back so the network can outgrow you.**

The switchboard operator who stays at the switchboard forever becomes a relic. The one who builds a telephone system becomes essential in a different way—not as the person routing calls, but as the person who made calling possible.

That's the move. **From operator to architect. From hub to builder. From essential to generative.**

The network doesn't need you at the center.

It needs you to make the center unnecessary.
