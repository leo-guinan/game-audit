# Resolution + Next Steps

---

The Performance Game is the most direct way to help others and the easiest to play poorly.

**Direct** because you're trying to create actual capability. Not just ideas (Game 2) or understanding (Game 3)—the ability to do something they couldn't do before.

**Easy to play poorly** because the game seems simple: show them how, and they'll learn. But expertise transfer is hard. The things that made you good are often invisible to you. The gap between watching and doing is vast.

Now that you can see the game:

- **If you're All Window:** Add the Mirror. Show them where they are, not just where they could be.
- **If you're All Mirror:** Add the Window. Give them something to move toward, not just away from.
- **If you're a Bottleneck:** Build systems. Create frameworks. Make your absence the test of your teaching.

The Performance Game, played well, produces **independence**. The person you helped should eventually not need you. They should be able to coach themselves—or even coach others.

That's the goal. Not students who depend on you. **Practitioners who surpass you.**
