# The Map Without Travelers

You built something good.

A framework that actually explains the phenomenon. A model that makes predictions. A way of seeing that, if people used it, would genuinely help them navigate.

And nobody uses it.

Maybe they don't understand it. Maybe it's too abstract. Maybe it requires too much context. Maybe it solves a problem they don't know they have.

You've refined the model. You've explained it multiple ways. You've written the blog post, made the diagram, given the presentation. Some people nod appreciatively. Then they go back to whatever they were doing before.

The map is accurate. It just doesn't have travelers.

## Why Maps Go Unused

A map is only useful if it **helps someone get somewhere they want to go**.

The Map Without Travelers usually fails on one of three dimensions:

- **Wrong territory.** The map describes somewhere the intended users don't need to go. Your framework is accurate but irrelevant to their problems.
- **Wrong resolution.** The map is too detailed or too abstract for practical use. Too detailed, and they can't see the paths for the landmarks. Too abstract, and they can't connect it to their specific situation.
- **Wrong interface.** The map is accurate and relevant, but they can't read it. The vocabulary is unfamiliar. The format doesn't match how they process information. The translation cost is higher than the navigation benefit.

Notice: none of these failures are about the map being wrong. They're about **the map being unusable**. Accuracy is not enough.

## What Travel-Ready Looks Like

The Map Without Travelers becomes useful when you **design for the traveler, not the territory**.

- **Start with the journey.** What are they trying to do? Where are they trying to go? Build the map backward from their destination, not forward from your understanding.
- **Test with travelers.** Put the map in someone's hands and watch them try to use it. Where do they get confused? Where do they ignore your careful work? That's feedback about usability, not validity.
- **Provide on-ramps.** The full model might be complex. Create simplified entry points—the "you are here" that lets someone start using the map immediately, even before they understand it fully.
- **Accept adaptation.** Travelers will modify your map. They'll ignore parts, emphasize others, combine it with maps from elsewhere. This isn't disrespect. It's use. A map that gets adapted is a map that's working.

The Model Game isn't won by having the best map. It's won by having **a map that helps people navigate**.
