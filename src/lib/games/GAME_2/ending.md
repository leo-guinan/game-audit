# Resolution + Next Steps

---

The Idea Game is the easiest to play and the hardest to win.

**Easy** because everyone has ideas. Because sharing them feels productive. Because the dopamine of insight is readily available.

**Hard** because the structure of the game routes value away from idea-havers. Because ideas don't compound the way other assets do. Because the market for raw insight is flooded.

Now that you can see the game:

- **If you're sitting on Unmined Veins:** Start refining. One idea, fully developed, beats a hundred in your notes app.
- **If your Claims keep getting Stolen:** Stop trying to own ideas. Own articulation, application, context, or speed.
- **If you're caught in the Prospector's Loop:** Commit to depth. Mark the new veins for later. Finish mining where you are.

The Idea Game, played well, is usually a **transition**. You use it to generate raw material for other games—the Identity Game (ideas become your canon), the Model Game (ideas become your frameworks), the Performance Game (ideas become your curriculum).

The pure Idea Game—ideas for their own sake, endlessly—is a trap. It produces value you can never capture.

The way out is through: into application, into identity, into building something that can hold the value your ideas create.
